<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">In</span> general, single vowels have the same sounds as in the
Continental pronunciation of Latin. The diphthong <i>ai</i> is
like <i>i</i> in fight; <i>ei</i> like <i>a</i> in gate; <i>au</i> like <i>ou</i> in bough. The
consonants are sounded as in English, except that <i>g</i> is always
hard and in the middle of a word is like a prolonged and very
nasal <i>ng</i>; and <i>z</i> before <i>u</i> is the equivalent of <i>dz</i>. When consonants
are doubled, both are distinctly enunciated. Syllables
are pronounced lightly and with nearly uniform accent
as in French, but vowels marked long are carefully lengthened.</p>

<h2><a name="chINTRO" id="chINTRO"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> term &quot;Spell,&quot; as applied to a series of
books treating of various countries seems instantly
to conjure up before the vision the most
romantic and attractive episodes in their history,
the most picturesque and fascinating aspects
of their geography, the most alluring
qualities of their inhabitants. Under this
ample and elastic term, Romance has been able
to weave its iridescent glamour, if possible enhancing
the charm of the reality, like a delicate
veil over a mountain view.</p>

<p class="indent">The fortunate authors have been enabled to
take journeys as it were on Solomon&#39;s magic
carpet, the aerial vehicle of the Imagination,
and to depict ideal conditions based nevertheless
on solid foundations of Truth.</p>

<p class="indent">Occasionally Fate seems to idealize reality:
a novelist could hardly conceive a more fortunate
setting for a romance than the Court
of an Oriental Potentate, or find a happier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageviii" id="pageviii"></a>[pg&nbsp;viii]</span>
source of vivid experiences than would spring
from the position of an open-eyed American
woman suddenly transported to such a scene
as the wife of an ambassador sent to some exotic
Empire. Fiction in such a case is transcended
by actual fact and there would be no
need of inventing opportunities of inner observation:
every door would stand open and
the country would be revealed in its highest
perfection.</p>

<p class="indent">In this respect Mrs. Anderson&#39;s &quot;Spell of
Japan&quot; differs perhaps from most of its predecessors
in the series of &quot;Spell&quot; books. Her
husband was appointed by President Taft in
1912 Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiary to the Court of His Majesty
the Mikado, and the whole time of their sojourn
in Dai Nippon was filled with experiences seldom
vouchsafed to foreigners. They witnessed
functions to which they were admitted only
because of their official position; they were
granted every facility for seeing aspects of
Japanese life which ordinary visitors would
have infallibly missed, and they became acquainted
with the very flower of Japanese civilization.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Anderson took copious notes and she
has utilized these in the preparation of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageix" id="pageix"></a>[pg&nbsp;ix]</span>
most delightful and illuminating volume. It is
so naturally and unostentatiously written that
one almost forgets to be amazed at the intimacy
of the pictures: one enters the Imperial palaces
and attends Court functions as simply as one
would go to an afternoon tea at home. Then
perhaps suddenly comes the realization of what
a privilege it is to be admitted to see through
her keenly observant eyes the penetralia so
jealously hidden from the general throng.</p>

<p class="indent">The book therefore is rightly entitled to
carry the title of Spell, for it shows Japan at
its very best; it makes one understand the
glamour which the courteous manners, the elaborate
customs, the harmonious costumes, the
perfect Art everywhere displayed, cast over
all those who have been fortunate enough to
visit the Land of the Rising Sun.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Anderson&#39;s book cannot fail to serve as
a new and important tie of friendship between
the United States and Japan; it will be hailed
as an eminently fair presentation of Japanese
ideals, and will from its authoritative accuracy
and its admirable spirit give great pleasure
to all in the best circles of the Empire and
serve to do away with many prejudices which
ignorance has disseminated among our own
people. It could not have breathed a more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagex" id="pagex"></a>[pg&nbsp;x]</span>
conciliatory and friendly spirit, and its simple
and engaging style cannot fail to win golden
opinions for its talented author.</p>

<h2><a name="chFW" id="chFW"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">My</span> recent residence in Japan, when we lived
in the Embassy in Tokyo, has served only to
enhance the Spell which that country has cast
over me since I first crossed the Pacific, sixteen
years ago. What beautiful summer evenings
were those on the Southern Seas, when the
moon was full! As we sat in the bow of the
<i>Doric</i> and sang to the music of the <i>eukalalie</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
we gazed into the water glistening with phosphorescence.
The mornings found us there
again, listening to the swish of the waves as
the boat slowly rose and sank on the long Pacific
swell. We watched the flying-fish, and the
schools of leaping porpoise, and the tropical
birds with their long white tail-feathers sailing
in the blue sky.</p>

Hawaiian guitar.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The excitements and interests on the steamer
were many and varied. On Sunday, while
Christians were singing hymns, Chinese and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexii" id="pagexii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xii]</span>
Jews gambled at fan-tan, Filipinos and Japanese
wrestled on the steerage deck, and Chinese
and Hindus knifed each other. Among the passengers
were missionaries with large families,
and wayward sons shipped to the East; in a
single group we saw an opium smuggler, a card
sharp, and the ever-present commercial traveller.</p>

<p class="indent">As we neared Japan a huge turtle floating on
the smooth surface of the water appeared to
have come out expressly to greet us and wish
us long life and happiness, for that is what he
represents to the Japanese. We are grateful
to him, for it is true he was a good omen; we
were on our honeymoon, and Japan cast its
Spell about us then and still holds us in its toils,
for we have returned again, and yet again.</p>

<p class="indent">As Japan consists of five hundred and eighteen
islands it is often called the Island Empire.
In the days of mythology and legend it was
named The Country in the Midst of the Luxuriant
Reed Plains; later it was The Mountain
Portal, while during the Middle Ages the Chinese
called it The Source of the Sun, or The
Land of the Rising Sun&mdash;Hinomoto. Finally
it became Nippon Dai Nippon&mdash;Great Japan.
But it has still other names, such as The Land
of the Gods, The Land of a Million Swords, The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiii" id="pagexiii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xiii]</span>
Land of the Cherry Blossoms, and The Land
Between Heaven and Earth.</p>

<p class="indent">Notwithstanding the changes of recent years,
the picturesque and enchanting Old Japan that
men of letters have written about so delightfully
still survives in many ways. The enormous
bronze Buddha at Kamakura sits calmly
looking down upon us, as always. At Nikko
the avenue of cryptomerias is still wonderfully
fine, while the huge blocks of stone in the long
flights of steps on the wooded mountain-side
bring up a vision of the armies of coolies who
placed them there to remain through the ages.
The bronze tombs are the same, only more beautifully
coloured with age, and the wood-carving
and lacquers of the glorious old temples have
been kept bright and new by faithful, loving
hands. The Inland Sea is just as mysterious
and ever-changing, while Fuji is worshipped
to-day as it has been since the beginning of all
time.</p>

<p class="indent">So much has been written&mdash;and well written&mdash;about
Old Japan, that in the language of the
Japanese, &quot;The Rustic and Stupid Wife is
loth to give to the Honourable and Wise Reader
these few poor notes.&quot; It is not so much of
Old Japan that I will write, however, but rather
of New Japan, of social and diplomatic life, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiv" id="pagexiv"></a>[pg&nbsp;xiv]</span>
present-day education, of motor trips, and politics,
of bear-hunting among the Ainus, and of
cruising in the Inland Sea.</p>

<p class="indent">Notwithstanding our four visits to Japan, on
all of which we kept journals, I wish to say that
I have begged, borrowed or stolen material
from travelling companions and others; I desire
to acknowledge my special indebtedness to
Mr. C. J. Arnell, of the American Embassy, who
kindly contributed the chapter on bear-hunting,
to Major Gosman, also of the Embassy Staff,
who gave me notes on motoring, to Mrs. Lucie
Chandler, who allowed me to use her conclusions
in regard to education and missionaries, to Miss
Hyde for the loan of her charming wood-cut,
and to the <i>Japan Magazine</i>. Much of my information,
besides, came from my husband&#39;s
journals. I wish also to thank Miss C. Gilman
and Miss K. Crosby, who have done so much
to help me in getting this book together.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">OUR last sight of Brussels, when we left
it in early December, was a row of
people, among whom was the Japanese
Minister, waving good-bye to us
at the Gare du Nord.</p>

<p class="indent">We were starting for the Far East, for my
husband had been transferred from his post in
Belgium to that of Ambassador to Japan.
This promotion was very pleasing to us, for
Eastern questions were vital, we liked the
Japanese people, and no country could have
been more interesting to us than the Land of
the Cherry Blossoms. It was our fourth visit
to the Orient, and, strange though it may seem,
when we reached Korea, the &quot;jumping-off
place,&quot; we said to ourselves that we began to
feel at home.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
A quick run across Germany and Russia
brought us to Moscow, where the great Chinese
walls reminded us that we had reached an outpost
of the Occident, a city which had once been
occupied by the Mongols. When the Siberian
Express pulled out of the station, we felt that
we had really said farewell to Europe and our
faces were turned toward the East. We crossed
the vast plains of eastern Russia and western
Siberia&mdash;monotonous expanses of white, only
relieved by the Ural Mountains, which at the
southern extremity of the range, where the
railroad passes over them, are not really mountains
at all, but hills.</p>

<p class="indent">Beyond the Obi River we rose from the level
steppe to the foot-hills of the Altai Mountains,
a forest region interspersed with open stretches
of good farming land&mdash;a country so much like
our own West that it is sometimes called &quot;the
new America.&quot; We passed immigrant trains
filled with Russian peasants, and the old road
over which the exiles used to march before the
railroad was built, and saw cars with barred
windows, like those of prisons, in which convicts
are transported.</p>

<p class="indent">The thermometer went down, down, as far as
forty degrees below zero, but the cars on the
Trans-Siberian were kept as warm as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
tropics. The drifts grew deeper, and there
were days and nights of endless snow. In the
hilly country around Lake Baikal we saw some
fine scenery. Low hills and high cliffs covered
with larches border its eastern and western
shores, but to the southward, a huge mountain
wall, lofty and snow-clad as our Californian
Sierras, closes in around the lake.</p>

<p class="indent">In comparison with our fast American
trains this &quot;express&quot; moved so slowly that
we feared we should be old, grey-haired men
and women before reaching the end of the journey.
It was a welcome sight when Kharbin at
last appeared, and we knew we were nearing
Manchuria. Most Siberian towns that we had
seen consisted of low wooden buildings, but
Kharbin contains many substantial brick structures.</p>

<p class="indent">It is supposed to be nine days from Moscow
to Kharbin, and fourteen days from London to
Tokyo direct, via Vladivostok. We were eighteen
days from Brussels to Kyoto, but we
stopped off at Seoul. Our route was through
Korea, which, as everybody knows, is now a
Japanese colony, because my husband wished
to see it on his way to his new post. Passengers
for Vladivostok left the train at Kharbin,
but we were to continue on southward toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
Changchun, where we expected to find Osame
Komori, a Japanese whom we had known for
many years, and who was to be my husband&#39;s
interpreter.</p>

<p class="indent">We had already received the following letter
from Osame:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Excellency</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My honourable sir, allow me the
liberty presenting you this letter. I
meet you Changchun. My gratitude is
higher than Fuji and sacred as the
Temple of Ise. Your kindness to me
is as deep as the Pacific Ocean. Your
letter was like sunshine in my life, your
news gave me the life from death....
I am total wreck by fire. We had
storms lately turning the beautiful
Fuji like silver capped mountain, but
grain still presents carpets of red and
yellow. About gold lacquer you write.
I made several enquiry when it will be
accomplished. I kick Y. urgently to
finish it.... My baby has grown well
and often repeat the honour of your
last visit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Best wishes I remain,</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Your Faithful Servant</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
Osame was better than his word, for he met
us at Kharbin instead of Changchun, bringing
with him supplies of various sorts, which he
thought might be acceptable.</p>

<p class="indent">After leaving Kharbin we passed through
Manchuria, a flat and low-rolling country, in
places somewhat roughened, where streams
have cut their way. The black earth is carefully
cultivated as far as the eye can see, and
at this season it was all in furrow. Little
primitive carts with shaggy ponies crossed the
landscape, laden with bags of the bean which
is the great product of this section. Every
now and then we passed small fortified guardhouses
of stone and brick, with the sentry at
his post, for protection against the brigands
who sweep down from the mountains
and try to carry off even parts of the railway.</p>

<p class="indent">At Changchun we were assured that the
Japanese Government wished us to be its
guests, and we found compartments reserved
for us on the Pullman train. From this point
we were escorted by Japanese officials, who
were sent to meet us and give us all the information
we could ask about the country. They
told us with bows that the train would be run
on a faster schedule than usual in our honour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
and sure enough, we soon were speeding over
the excellent road-bed at a good rate.</p>

<p class="indent">As we went on, the snow began to disappear,
and the sharp mountains of Korea came in
sight, with little villages tucked away in the
ravines. For Chosen, the Land of Morning
Calm, as it is always called in Japan, is a country
of mountains. Granite peaks, deep gorges
and fertile valleys are everywhere in the interior,
and the rugged, irregular eastern coastline,
of which we had a glimpse in crossing to
Japan, winds in and out around the base of the
ranges. Among the hills and groves that we
passed were the mounds of buried ancestors.
We were much impressed by the sturdy, well
set-up appearance of the Japanese soldiers
along the route, and the military bearing of
their officers.</p>

<p class="indent">Here live the bear and deer, and the long-haired
Korean tiger, so well-known to sportsmen.
Foreign sportsmen are free to hunt
among these hills wherever they will and they
find it a strange sensation to watch for tigers
on ridges from which they can look down on
the thatched roofs of small villages, or to hear
at night from their tent in the village the cough
of the tiger seeking his prey on the hills. The
wild pigs and hog deer, startled by this cough,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
flee in blind terror, and are seized by the tiger
as they dash past him. In every village a hornblower
is on the watch at night, and when he
sounds his horn, all the people beat their
tiger alarms of tin pans to drive the animal
away.</p>

<p class="indent">The Korean peasants eat the meat and drink
the blood of a slain tiger in the belief that this
will render them brave and strong. They
make an all-powerful medicine from the long
white whiskers, and use the tiny collar-bones
as charms to protect them from any devils they
chance to meet.</p>

<p class="indent">Although it was winter, both men and women
were dressed in white cotton, which looked
rather startling after the dark costumes of the
Chinese and the fur coats of the Russians.
White used to be the badge of mourning in
Korea, but now it is the national costume. Various
stories are told to account for its adoption.
According to one of these, in the early
part of the nineteenth century three kings died
in close succession, and as every one was
obliged to wear mourning for three years after
the death of a ruler, at the end of this period
all the dyers had become discouraged and given
up their business, and so white became the dress
of the people. Now, when the men are in real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
mourning, they wear huge straw hats, and do
not think it proper to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">Although white is still the national costume,
the Emperor, some years ago, published an
edict giving his subjects permission to wear
other colours. The nobles wear a number of
coats of the finest cream-coloured silk lawn,
over which there may be an outer garment of
blue. The white garments impose a needless
burden upon the women of the lower classes,
who are incessantly engaged in laundry work.
The coats are ripped to pieces and washed in
some stream, where they are pounded on stones,
then after they are dry are placed on wooden
cylinders and beaten with sticks until the white
cotton has taken on the sheen of dull satin.</p>

<p class="indent">Korean men wear curious little open-work
hats of black horsehair, which make them look
very tall and slight and give them a dudish
appearance. They present an especially funny
picture when riding a bullock. The women, on
the contrary, are wound about in white cotton
to such an extent that they look rather Turkish,
and they waddle as if bow-legged. Many of
them are comical in green silk coats, with which
they cover their heads without putting their
arms into the sleeves. They were allowed to
wear these garments as a badge of honour for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
their bravery in battle, or, as some say, that
they might be ready at a moment&#39;s notice to
change them into soldiers&#39; coats.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 448px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">A KOREAN COUPLE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It is said that the broad-brimmed hat sometimes
worn by the men originated, several centuries
ago, in the efforts of one of the emperors
to put a stop to drunkenness. He decreed that
all the men should have a light earthen-ware
hat of the shape worn to-day, which was never
to be taken off, except when they were lying
down. The head was protected against the hard
surface of this covering by a light padded cap
beneath. As the rooms of Korean houses are
small, not more than four men could be seated
in one, if they had this peculiar headgear.
When any one was found to have a broken hat,
it was taken for granted that he had been in
some drunken brawl, and he received the prescribed
punishment.</p>

<p class="indent">On our arrival in Seoul, we were met by
Japanese officials, and were also greeted by
our Consul-General, Mr. Scidmore.</p>

<p class="indent">Seoul is charmingly situated in a valley surrounded
by beautiful white-capped mountains,
over which wanders the high wall that encloses
the city. The old entrance gates are massive
structures&mdash;great foundations of stone with
arches cut through them, on which rise the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
double recurving roofs of tile. The old town
with its narrow alleys and its filth has well-nigh
disappeared. Under Japanese administration,
the gates are no longer closed at night,
for there is police protection, and parts of the
city are lighted by electricity. The new streets
are wide, clean and well drained. Although
Korea is called the Hermit Kingdom, and said
to be many years behind Japan, there are telegraph
lines, electric cars, bicycles, even one or
two motors, brick houses and a Railway Station
Hotel. The Japanese portion of the town
was gay with flags flying from bamboo staffs,
in honour of the approaching New Year, and
red and white lanterns swung along the ridgepoles.</p>

<p class="indent">One peculiarity of Korean houses strikes a
Westerner as very strange. As their walls and
floors are of stone or brick, it is possible to heat
them in the same manner as the Chinese <i>kang</i>,
that is, by fires built below. So, many of them
are warmed in this way, the wood being put in
from the outside through an opening in the wall
of the house, and the smoke escaping through
a chimney on the opposite side. A network of
pipes under the floors carries the hot air to
every part of the building.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">A VIEW OF SEOUL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">We visited the old palace where the dethroned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
Emperor and Empress used to live.
It is rather Chinese in appearance, but not
quite so handsome as the palace in Peking,
which we had seen previously. The approach
to it is by a broad way lined on each side with
low, tile-roofed houses; this leads to the great
<i>Mon</i>, the entrance gate, with double overhanging
roofs towering above it. Inside this is a
great court, next another massive gateway with
two-storied upturned roofs, then another courtyard,
around which are low houses, and a third
gate, leading into the last court, which is approached
by terraced steps of stone. Finally
appears the audience hall, a building with recurving
roofs of tile, beautiful carvings, and
brilliant decorations in colour. Passages and
courts lead from this to the pleasure pavilion,
a large, open, two-storied structure with a
heavy pagoda roof, which stands on a stone
terrace, and is reached by three bridges with
stone balustrading. Beside it is a tank where
lotus grows, and near-by a park-like grove of
quaint pine-trees.</p>

<p class="indent">In this palace, several years ago, Empress
Bin of Korea was assassinated while asleep.
The Emperor, however, dressed as a coolie, escaped
to the Russian Legation, where he lived
for two years. He afterward built himself a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
new palace in European style, where he resides
now as a sort of prisoner, while his son lives
in another palace, and the grandson is being
educated in Japan. The Emperor is now known
as Prince Yi the Elder, and his son as Prince
Yi the Younger, while his grandson, who also
bears the same name, is the last of the Yi
dynasty, which has ruled Korea for five hundred
years.</p>

<p class="indent">As we all know, Korea was involved in the
two terrible wars that have been waged in the
Far East in recent years. Japan needs Korea
as an outlet for her surplus population, as a
source of food supply and a market for her
manufactured products, but still more does she
need it as a strong country to stand between
herself and Russian aggression. In the last
decade of the nineteenth century the Hermit
Kingdom was still under the suzerainty of
China, and its government was weak and hopelessly
corrupt. Japan refused to acknowledge
this overlordship of China, and insisted that
the Korean government must be reformed.
China was asked to help in enforcing the
changes, but refused to interfere. Neither
China nor Japan would yield.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally the Koreans sent for Chinese troops,
and then the Japanese attacked the Emperor&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
palace. A great naval battle was fought at the
mouth of the Yalu River, in which the Chinese
were defeated and five of their ships sunk. The
Japanese army took Dalny and Port Arthur.
Another naval battle ended in the surrender of
the Chinese fleet and the suicide of the Chinese
admiral. Togo and Yamagata, whom I once had
the pleasure of meeting at a luncheon in Tokyo,
and Nogi, were among the heroes of this war.
By the treaty of Shimonoseki, in 1895, China
agreed to pay an indemnity to Japan and to
recognize the independence of Korea, and also
ceded the Liaotung Peninsula with Port Arthur,
and the islands of Formosa and the
Pescadores group to Japan. No sooner was
this treaty signed, however, than the Great
Powers compelled Japan to restore Liaotung
to China.</p>

<p class="indent">But within a few years, Russia obtained a
lease of Liaotung, and the Powers made no
protest. She soon invested immense sums in
Manchuria&mdash;in building the Manchurian Railroad,
in fortifying Port Arthur and making it
a naval base, and extending the Chinese Eastern
Railroad toward the Yalu and Korea. She
made Kharbin her military base and filled
Manchuria with soldiers.</p>

<p class="indent">Japan saw the necessity of protecting not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
only her freedom of trade, but her very existence
as a nation, for Russia, from her vantage
ground in Manchuria, had begun to take possession
of the valley of the Yalu River, on
Korea&#39;s northwestern frontier. Once this section
was in her power it would be an easy
matter to sweep down through the peninsula
and across the narrow Straits of Shimonoseki
to the Island Empire itself.</p>

<p class="indent">In vain did Japan try to open up negotiations
with Russia. On one excuse or another, she
was put off for months, while all the time Russia
was preparing for war. Finally diplomatic
relations were severed by order of Baron Komura,
Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs,
and war was declared February 10, 1904.
Baron Kaneko, in an address before the Japan
Club of Harvard University, in April of that
year, said that Japan was fighting to maintain
the peace of Asia and to conserve the influence
of Anglo-American civilization in the East.</p>

<p class="indent">After Admiral Togo had destroyed the Russian
fleet, and the long siege of Port Arthur
had ended in its surrender to the heroic Nogi,
all the Japanese armies combined for the final
struggle around Mukden, which terminated in
the flight of the Russians from Manchuria.
The treaty of peace, which was signed at Portsmouth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
New Hampshire, gave Japan Port Arthur,
a protectorate over Korea, and half the
island of Saghalien, and provided that both
nations should evacuate Manchuria. The protectorate
over Korea has since become a sovereignty.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese Governor-General, Count Terauchi,
is a very strong and able man, and
under his administration many improvements
have been made in Korea. This has not always
been done without friction between the natives
and their conquerors, it must be confessed, but
the results are certainly astonishing. The
government has been reorganized, courts have
been established, the laws have been revised,
trade conditions have been improved and commerce
has increased. Agriculture has been encouraged
by the opening of experiment stations,
railroads have been constructed from the
interior to the sea-coast, and harbours have
been dredged and lighthouses erected. Japanese
expenditures in Korea have amounted to
twelve million dollars yearly.</p>

<p class="indent">The Governor-General gave us a dinner at
his residence, a big European house, where
everything was done in European style. The
four Japanese ladies who received, however,
were all in native costume&mdash;black kimonos,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
which they wear for ceremony only, and superb
gold <i>obis</i>, or sashes. One of them was the
Governor&#39;s daughter, Countess Kodama, who
was very beautiful. I went in to dinner with
the Governor-General, and had on the other
side a Japanese doctor of the Red Cross, who
had been much in America and was well acquainted
with Miss Boardman, the head of our
Red Cross here.</p>

<p class="indent">Our delightful luncheon at the Consulate
must not be forgotten, for no more charming
people could be found anywhere than the Scidmores.
Miss Scidmore is the author of &quot;Jinrikisha
Days,&quot; as well as other books on the
East. The remarkably pretty Consulate,
which is owned by our Government, is an old
Korean house, or <i>yamen</i>, built in a walled compound
on the slope of a hill. Having only one
story, it presented more the appearance of a
studio than of a residence, but was made cozy
with open fires and attractive with many beautiful
curios.</p>

<p class="indent">The religions of Korea are Buddhism, Confucianism
and Shamanism, all found there to-day.
Shamanism is the form of worship of
the more primitive masses. There are many
Buddhist temples in Chosen. For instance,
among the peaks of Keum-Kang-San alone, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
the heart of the Korean mountains, there are
over fifty monasteries and shrines, but all more
or less in a state of decay. Christianity was
brought into the country by the Roman Catholics
in 1777.</p>

<p class="center">THE AMERICAN CONSULATE. SEOUL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The American colony in Seoul numbers about
five hundred, among them being many Methodist
and Presbyterian missionaries. In regard
to the recent troubles between these missionaries
and the Japanese the accounts differ. The
Governor was attacked by some Koreans, and,
of course, ordered an investigation and the trial
of those accused. Some of the Koreans asserted
that they were tortured by the Japanese
during their imprisonment, but in most cases
this was proved untrue. The missionaries, having
been the advisers of the natives in all kinds
of ways, should not be too harshly judged for
taking the part of those whom they believed
innocent.</p>

<p class="indent">The results of mission work in Chosen are
certainly very striking. I was told by an unprejudiced
observer that the largest congregations
she ever saw were in Seoul, and she was
assured that, farther north, the numbers drawn
into the churches were still greater. Even if
we admit that some of these converts were won
over by the hope of material gain, we cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
fail to see that all this work has had a humanizing
effect, which is especially needed in this
country.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the best work of the missions is done
in schools and hospitals&mdash;especially in hospitals.
Hygienic conditions among natives not in
contact with foreigners are frightful, and their
ideas of medicine and surgery are most primitive.
From mere ignorant attempts to aid
alone there is tremendous physical suffering.
The foreign hospitals have now won the confidence
of the people, so that in the end they
always make application there.</p>

<p class="indent">When we left Seoul, many Japanese officials
were at the station in the early morning to say
good-bye, among them being General Akashi,
Count Kodama, and others. At every town of
any importance, during our journey south, the
mayor, the chief of police, reporters and hotelkeepers
came to the train, presented their
cards, and exchanged pleasant remarks with
my husband. We were surprised to see how
many of them spoke English.</p>

<p class="indent">Southern Korea is quite beautiful, with fine
snow mountains and cultivated terraces, where
rice is raised by irrigation. The red soil is
very fertile, but the mountains are bare of
trees, the Koreans having cut down the forests.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
As the Japanese have made good forest laws,
however, the trees will now be allowed to grow
again. The whole trip through Korea was
beautiful and most interesting, and in the south
particularly we noticed that numbers of Japanese
immigrants were settling in the country.</p>

<p class="indent">The colonial possessions of Japan include
not only Korea, but part of Saghalien, Formosa
and one or two groups of islands in the
north. It was to Saghalien that the most desperate
of Russian convicts were sent for many
years. The southern half was ceded to
Japan after the Russo-Japanese War. It
has proved quite a valuable asset, inasmuch
as it contains extensive forests of pines, larches
and other trees of sub-Arctic regions, is noted
for its fisheries, and abounds in sables, the
fur of which is shipped to Japan. These last
are perhaps not so fine as the best Russian
sables, but they are of good quality, nevertheless.</p>

<p class="indent">Formosa, which I had seen on a previous
visit to the East, lies to the southward, off the
coast of China. About one half as large as Ireland,
it consists in the west of a narrow, fertile
plain, and in the centre and east of mountains,
which descend to the coast in sheer precipices
over three thousand feet high. Mt. Morrison,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
the loftiest peak on the island, is higher than
Fuji, and has been renamed by the Japanese
Nii-taka-yama, the New High Mountain. The
ascent of Mt. Morrison discloses all the variety
and luxuriance of vegetation seen nowhere except
on a peak in the tropics. At the lower
levels are palms, banyans, huge camphor trees,
tree-ferns and rare orchids, and impenetrable
growths of rattans; higher up are cryptomerias&mdash;giant
cedars; still higher, pine-trees;
and alternate tracts of forest and areas of
grass land extend to the very top.</p>

<p class="indent">The word <i>formosa</i>, which means beautiful,
was given to the island by the first Portuguese
navigators who sailed along its coast. It is
indeed one of the loveliest islands of the Far
East. In the late afternoon, the day we passed
by, the sky was a hazy grey and the island a
delicate mauve. The sun disappeared behind
the peaks, and the heavens became a glowing
red, transforming the mountains into dark, flaming
volcanoes. As darkness came on, the heat
was so great that we slept on deck. The beautiful
Southern Cross gleamed above the horizon,
and the glory of the sunset gave place to
the wonderful, mystic charm of a tropical night.</p>

<p class="indent">After having been occupied by China for
over two centuries, Formosa was ceded to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
Japan in 1895. Here, as in Korea, Japanese
administration has introduced great changes,
and it is difficult to realize that railways and
electric lights are to be found in this remote
part of the earth. In return Formosa supplies
Japan with rice, tea and sugar. It also produces
nearly all the camphor used in the
world.</p>

<p class="indent">The Chinese, during their possession of the
island, inhabited only the western section, and
had no power whatever over the wild Malays
of the eastern half. These savages are head-hunters,
and are difficult to handle, because
they enjoy above everything else that most terrible
and exciting game in the world, the game
of taking another man&#39;s head. They dance
war dances, and keep the skulls of their slain
enemies as drinking-cups, from which they
drink wine made from the brains of their victims.
The Japanese have devised an ingenious
scheme for keeping the head-hunters under
control and conquering them. They have encircled
the mountain peaks with a live electric
wire, and have stationed guards at intervals
along the line. The natives have learned the
danger of this. Now the Japanese are gradually
moving the wire higher and higher, so
eventually they will have the savages pocketed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
and will subdue them by starvation or otherwise.</p>

<p class="indent">After our brief stay in Seoul we bade farewell
to the Colonies and turned our faces
toward the Land of the Rising Sun itself, making
the crossing from Chosen to Shimonoseki
in a single night. This is far pleasanter than
the passage from Vladivostok, which requires
several days. In order to attract travellers,
the Japanese have put their best cars and boats
on this route. Our last glimpse of the Hermit
Kingdom was a picture of jagged peaks rising
in lofty precipices from a moonlit sea, their
black masses outlined in solemn grandeur
against the heavens.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illo_057.jpg" width="100" height="120" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a day&#39;s journey in the train
from the coast to Kyoto. We ran
through stretches of glistening
paddy-fields, with their patches of
bright green crops and rows of yellow straw-stacks,
and then through long villages of tiny
thatch-roofed houses, or by avenues of twisted
pine-trees. We passed bullock carts and
strangely laden horses, and people clip-clipping
along on their wooden clogs, and arrived
finally, late on Christmas Eve, at Kyoto, the
ancient capital.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">
<a name="illo_055" id="illo_055"></a><img class="border" src="images/illo_055.jpg" width="700" height="450" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;WE PASSED ... STRANGELY LADEN HORSES.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">To our delight and surprise, we found that
the thoughtful hotel proprietor had arranged
a pretty Christmas tree in our parlour. So
we had supper and exchanged gifts, although
the hour was late, and felt that in spite of being
so far from home we were having a real
Christmas after all.</p>

<p class="indent">We stopped in Kyoto for the especial purpose
of making a pilgrimage to the burial place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
of the late Emperor Mutsuhito, now known as
Meiji Tenno. The emperors take their posthumous
name from the name of their era; the
present Emperor has chosen to call his era
Tai-Sho, for instance, which means Great Righteousness.
As L. wished to pay his respects,
it was arranged that we should visit Momoyama,
where the late Emperor is buried.</p>

<p class="indent">As all diplomats are obliged to wear Court
mourning, we put on our deepest black&mdash;I
had a crêpe veil and bonnet which I had been
wearing for the mother of the King of Belgium.
We went in a motor. The roads were excellent,
and the people made way for us, so that we ran
with speed and comfort, even through the narrow
streets of the continuous village with their
congested traffic.</p>

<p class="indent">The place chosen for the tomb of Mutsuhito
is on a hill beyond Kyoto where there is a fine
outlook which the late Emperor greatly loved.
As we drew near, constabulary, who were apparently
waiting for us, directed and stopped
the traffic, so that we soon reached the broad
new highway which had been made for the
funeral. It is a wide gravel road winding
around the base of the mountain to the low-lying
buildings about the tomb. These are of
the simplest style. Indeed, the entire burial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
place and shrine are in the Shinto fashion, very
plain in form and arrangement.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">
<a name="illo_267" id="illo_267"></a><img class="border" src="images/illo_267.jpg" width="700" height="443" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">THE TOMB OF MUTSUHITO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">We were met by the Honourable Chief
Keeper of the Tomb, a Japanese gentleman in
a frock coat and top hat who conducted us into
a pavilion at one side, where seats were placed
at the head of a table. Here we sat for a few
moments, and then, preceded by the Keeper,
passed into the wide gravelled courtyard surrounded
by houses and walls of plain wood.
There are two &quot;wash-hand&quot; places at one
side, between which a path leads to steps that
ascend from the court toward the burial place.
People are admitted to this courtyard, and at
times over a hundred thousand have come in
a single day to worship the memory of the late
Mikado. Princes and ambassadors may go beyond
this space, however, so we bowed and
passed up another gravelled way to the Memorial
Temple, in its simple Shinto style. Immediately
above this, higher up on the hill, is the
temple beneath which the Emperor&#39;s body is
buried.</p>

<p class="indent">At one side of the Memorial Temple, in a
small pavilion, three figures were squatting,
immobile and expressionless. These were noblemen,
dressed in ancient fashion. Here we
found a mat on which we knelt for a while, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
rose and bowed again toward the tomb, and
then toward the figures in the pavilion, who
bowed in return. After that we passed out as
we had come.</p>

<p class="indent">It had really been a most impressive ceremonial,
although so simple. As we had been
received by his late Majesty in audience and
at luncheon, there was something personal as
well as official in the respect which we had tried
to show by our pilgrimage. Afterward we
heard that it had been greatly appreciated by
the Japanese officials and people, who consider
their Imperial family almost divine.</p>

<p class="indent">The funeral of the Emperor occurred several
months before our arrival in Japan. From all
accounts it must have been a very wonder of
wonders. Special ambassadors came from
every country as guests of the Japanese Government,
and fine houses were put at their disposal.
Mr. Knox, our Secretary of State, was
conveyed from the United States in a man-of-war.
Great pavilions in Shinto style were
erected in Tokyo to accommodate the distinguished
guests during the evening of the procession,
and feasts were provided for them.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">THE FUNERAL CORTEGE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">As it had been so long since an Emperor had
died, special Shinto services had to be arranged.
The funeral was at night. The music
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
was very weird and sad, and the wheels of the
funeral car, which was drawn by oxen, were
made to creak as they ran along, as if writhing
and crying in agony for the loss of the Great
Emperor they were bearing to his resting-place.</p>

<p class="indent">High officials, officers, and priests, in old ceremonial
costumes or modern uniforms, were in
the procession, and the brightly decorated avenue,
lined with soldiers and crowded with onlookers,
made a weird picture in the flashing
lights&mdash;one never to be forgotten, I should
imagine, by those who were fortunate enough
to witness it. After passing in this fashion
through the streets of Tokyo the body was put
on the train and conveyed to Kyoto, where the
procession was resumed to the tomb.</p>

<p class="indent">Of its reception in Kyoto, Terry, author of
&quot;The Japanese Empire,&quot; says: &quot;To the distant
crashing and the reverberating roar of
minute-guns; the wailing of bugles and the
booming of gigantic temple bells; to the sound
of the wild minstrelsy of priests and bonzes,
the pattering of a weeping, drenching rain and
the sighing of a vast concourse of mourning
people ... the mortal remains of Mutsuhito
... were laid tenderly in their last resting
place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A poem written by the late Emperor and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
translated by Dr. Bryan has recently been published.
It is called &quot;My People,&quot; and although
so short is rather impressive.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Kyoto, sometimes called Saikyo, was the ancient
capital, where the shoguns and mikados
used to reside in the early days. It is a city
of temples, where nothing under three hundred
years is counted old, and although typically
Japanese it seems somehow different from
other cities. The tiny houses and narrow
streets appear tinier and narrower here than
elsewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">The hills to the east of the city are covered
with old shrines and buildings, and the woods
are full of temples, too. In the Chionin Temple,
founded some seven hundred years ago,
may be seen an umbrella left among the rafters
of the roof by the master-builder during its
erection. Tradition insists that it flew thither
out of the hands of a boy whose shape had been
assumed by the guardian deity of the temple,
but the other explanation, while less romantic,
seems more probable. Near this temple, on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
small elevation among the trees, stands the
Great Bell, the largest in the country. Not far
away are many other interesting things, among
them the Dai Butsu&mdash;the Great Buddha.
There are also some sacred springs, a curious
temple on stilts, and innumerable lanterns.</p>

<p class="indent">The two most important temples are the
Eastern and the Western Hongwanji, which
belong to the most powerful Buddhist sect.
We went through the latter, which had some
excellent paintings. The garden and houses
belonging to this temple, which are six hundred
years old, were built by Hideyoshi, the
famous &quot;clever boy,&quot; who from nothing at all
became shogun. The Eastern temple is described
in the chapter dealing with religions.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">HIDEYOSHI&#39;S HOUSE AND GARDEN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The approach to the Gosho Palace, once the
abode of the mikados, is not very attractive,
leading through a bare, flat park. Our interest
was soon aroused, however, by the sight of one
of the six gates of the palace, through which
we drove, following the grey wall with its
stripes of white and its tiles showing the sixteen-petalled
chrysanthemums&mdash;both emblems
of royalty. Another gate, perhaps a little
smaller than the first, brought us to the immediate
entrance. The building is comparatively
new, the old palace having been destroyed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
fire in 1854, but it is very large, covering an
area of twenty-six acres.</p>

<p class="indent">Two officials greeted us at the inner gate,
and, after politely asking us to remove our
shoes, conducted us down the long, narrow corridor
to what were probably waiting-rooms.
There were three of these, decorated in sepia.
From here we were led through another corridor,
past the room with a dais at one end for
the higher nobility, where the courtiers used
to dine off the flat, red lacquer tables, to the
Seiryoden&mdash;the Pure and Cool Hall&mdash;a room
used for religious festivals, with marvellously
coloured birds painted upon its walls. This
hall received its name from a small stream of
clear water which runs through a sluiceway
near-by. Opening from this is a courtyard in
which grow two clumps of bamboo, named centuries
ago for the two ancient Chinese kingdoms,
Kan and Go&mdash;Kan-chiku and Go-chiku.</p>

<p class="indent">To the right of the Seiryoden is a room which
is reserved for special audiences, called Shishinden,
or Mysterious Purple Hall. In the
centre of this is a platform on which stands the
throne, a great chair inlaid with mother-of-pearl.
It is covered by a canopy of pale fawn-coloured
brocade with outer drapings of red
and purple, and is guarded by the two sacred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
dogs. The walls of this room are painted in
panels representing Chinese sages, the panels
being copies of the originals, which were
painted in 888 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> and afterward destroyed
by fire. Leading from the courtyard into the
hall is a flight of fifteen steps, corresponding
in number to the grades into which officials of
government were divided. The higher order
stood on the upper step, and so on down to
those who were obliged to stand in the court.
On one side of the steps is a wild orange tree
named Ukon-No-Tachibana, and on the other
a cherry tree, Sakon-No-Sakura.</p>

<p class="indent">From this hall we passed through more galleries,
and through one particularly beautiful
chamber with decorations of wild geese in sepia.
At the end of a corridor, making a turn to the
left, we came to some more waiting-rooms,
decorated in blue and white&mdash;the most
heavenly blue, surely pieces of the sky brought
down from the kingdom of the gods by the first
illustrious ruler! Here tea and cigarettes were
offered us, and we were glad to rest and enjoy
the view of the landscape garden with its miniature
lake and islands on which were temples
and twisted trees.</p>

<p class="indent">From this room we passed through more
corridors to the entrance, where we bowed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
our guide, put on our shoes, and departed, with
a feeling of having been soothed and rested by
the beautiful simplicity and solemnity of the
Gosho Palace.</p>

<p class="indent">Once more out in the sunshine, we drove
through the park into the streets of the city
and on to the Nijo Castle. This palace, formerly
belonging to the shoguns, dates from the
early part of the seventeenth century. Its
splendid iron-bound gates are fine specimens of
Japanese architecture and carving. It is much
more resplendent than the Mikado&#39;s palace,
having been built in a spirit of rivalry to show
the superior wealth and power of the Shogun.
We were received here in the same cordial
manner as at the Gosho, and after removing
our shoes were taken into a small antechamber,
which had two superb doors made
of the cryptomeria tree with bronze studdings
and hinges. Then followed a series of
rooms, the first of which was set aside for the
<i>samurai</i> and decorated with tigers with intent,
awful eyes, crouching, rampant, even flying, on
a background of glorious gold.</p>

<p class="indent">From these we passed into the rooms used
by the <i>daimyos</i>, and on from room to room,
every apartment having its golden setting,
which was so rich and mellow with age that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
we seemed to be breathing in the creamy softness
of it. In each of these suites were secret
closets, where guards were stationed in olden
times, unseen by the assembly. One chamber
with its paintings of pine-trees was very attractive
in its simplicity; the next delighted
us with remarkable carvings; the following
one, with its cherry blossoms and its ceiling,
so pleased the late Emperor that he had it
copied for the banquet-room of his palace in
Tokyo. Still another apartment, with its bamboo
decorations, rivalled those we had seen
before, while the last one had a pathetic touch
with its poor little cold and starving sparrows.</p>

<p class="indent">One door of especial note showed a heron, wet,
cold and miserable, standing on the gunwale of
a boat. The grain of the wood had been skilfully
used by the artist to represent a rainstorm.
The door had unfortunately been much
damaged by vandalism during the régime of the
Kyoto prefecture in 1868.</p>

<p class="indent">From a long series of rooms radiant with sunshine
we entered others which had the moonlight
for their setting&mdash;all so beautiful that it is
difficult to express one&#39;s admiration. From this
suite we were led finally back to the entrance
once more, arriving there bewildered by the
vast number of rooms, the length of the corridors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
and the splendour of all that we had
seen.</p>

<p class="indent">It was in this palace that the last of the Shoguns
formally turned over his power to the
Mikado, an event which marked the beginning
of the new era for Japan.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Japanese history, with which Kyoto is closely
identified, begins with myth and fable. No definite
facts or dates are known, previous to the
fifth century <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> According to legend, the
country was first created by Izanagi and his
wife Izanami; from his left eye came the Sun-Goddess
and from his right eye the moon, while
a tempestuous god came from his nose. He
was blessed with more than a hundred children,
but, in spite of this, his wife, Izanami, died and
went to Hades. Although their parents were
divine, the children were only demi-gods, and
came to earth by means of a floating bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">The Sun-Goddess, Ama-terasu, was given partial
control of the new realm. She appointed
her grandson, Ninigi, and his descendants for
ever, sovereigns of Japan. Before leaving his
grandmother&#39;s kingdom Ninigi was presented
with a sacred mirror, sword and jewel. The
mirror is shown at the shrine of Ise, the sword
in a temple near Nagoya, while the stone has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
always been kept by the Mikado. Ninigi, accompanied
by a host of gods, alighted upon a
mountain in the province of Satsuma, and his
son, Jimmu Tenno, finally made a conquest of
Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">The Emperor Jimmu is said to have been
the first human sovereign in the land. He
rowed up through the Inland Sea with his warriors,
overcoming and subjugating the savages
whom he encountered. All this happened during
the seventh century before Christ. February
eleventh is the date celebrated as the
anniversary of his coronation as Emperor, but,
of course, not only the date but even his very
existence, is uncertain. The present Emperor
is believed to be a direct descendant of this first
ruler.</p>

<p class="indent">Some think that Jimmu Tenno may have been
a Chinese warrior, for it is true that during
the third and fourth centuries <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> vast hordes
of Chinese and Koreans invaded the country,
bringing with them the arts and sciences of
civilization, as well as the religion of Buddha.
The Ainus, who were probably the original
Island people, began to disappear and are now
found only on the northern island of Hokkaido&mdash;also
called Yezo.</p>

<p class="indent">The first woman who seems to have taken an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
active part in Japanese history is the Empress
Jingo (Singokogu). She is supposed to have
lived in the third century <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> and to have made
a conquest of Korea, which she added to her
other possessions.</p>

<p class="indent">The son of Sujin, &quot;the Civilizer,&quot; became
known as the Merciful Emperor, because he did
away with the terrible custom of burying alive,
with a deceased Emperor, his family, retainers,
and animals. Instead, he substituted clay figures
about the tomb. This is still the fashion,
for such figures were placed inside the tomb
of the late Emperor. They are also to be seen
on the avenue leading to the Ming Tombs, near
the Great Wall of China.</p>

<p class="indent">Kyoto became the seat of the mikados during
the eighth century <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> and was known as the
Western Capital. From the twelfth century on,
these descendants of the Sun-Goddess were
rulers of Japan in theory only, however. In
reality the power was held by a succession of
powerful nobles&mdash;mayors of the palace, like
the Carolingians in mediæval Europe&mdash;who
were called <i>shoguns</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The shoguns continued in power for nearly a
thousand years, living at first in Kyoto but
later&mdash;in the sixteenth century&mdash;removing to
Tokyo (Yedo), which became the Eastern Capital.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
They never claimed supremacy, always
affirming that they ruled the country simply by
authority delegated to them from the Mikado.
Any titles or honours which they wished to
bestow upon themselves or their favourites
were given in the name of the Emperor.</p>

<p class="indent">The Portuguese were the first foreigners to
arrive, coming in 1542. With them were Jesuit
priests, who, under cover of attempted conversion,
were thought to be plotting a Portuguese
conquest of the country. As a result of this
discovery, in 1587, an edict was issued that all
Christian teachers should leave Japan. Later
even more stringent measures were taken for
the destruction of the Church, and all proselytes
were called upon to recant.</p>

<p class="indent">After this event two centuries and a half of
peaceful seclusion, known as the Tokugawa
Period, followed. The founder of this dynasty
was Tokugawa Iyeyasu, a general of great
genius who succeeded in bringing the other
nobles to terms and in establishing a strong
and effective central government. Bismarck
is said to have described him as &quot;a great man
long trained in the school of adversity.&quot; Feudalism
reached its perfection under his rule.</p>

<p class="indent">While the shoguns were in power they owned
all the land in the realm. This land they leased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
to the <i>daimyo</i>, or barons. These in turn sublet
to their vassals, the brave <i>samurai</i>, who formed
the fighting class and gave military service to
their lords for the value received. Merchants,
traders, manufacturers, farmers, artisans and
coolies, all owed allegiance to their immediate
master, who stood next above them in the social
scale.</p>

<p class="indent">During the Tokugawa Period art and letters
flourished. The country was at peace, and well
governed. The only foreigners allowed in the
country were the Chinese and Dutch traders,
who might enter the harbour of Nagasaki under
guard.</p>

<p class="indent">To Americans the most interesting date in
Japanese history is that of July 14th, 1853,
when Commodore Perry appeared with his
black ships, his big guns, and a letter from the
President of the United States to the Shogun
of Japan. (Foreigners did not realize that the
Shogun was not the supreme authority.) Prince
Tokugawa not only received the letter, which
was contrary to national law, but in due time
consented to the opening of certain ports to
foreign trade.</p>

<p class="indent">Soon after this, the &quot;open door&quot; policy
proving unpopular with the people, the country
found itself in the throes of a revolution which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
resulted, in 1868, in the restoration of the Mikado
to the throne of his ancestors and to the
power which went with it. Prince Keiki Tokugawa,
the fifteenth of the House of Tokugawa
and last of the shoguns, retired in favour of
the Emperor, Meiji Tenno. He survived the
Emperor by over a year, dying in November,
1913.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the Imperial line was restored to
power, their capital, Kyoto, was abandoned in
favour of Tokyo, which has remained the seat
of government ever since.</p>

<h2><a name="chIII" id="chIII"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="h3">FIRST DAYS AT THE EMBASSY</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illo_078.jpg" width="100" height="117" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SOON after Christmas we left Kyoto
for Tokyo. After having been on the
train eighteen days I looked forward
with pleasure to being quiet once
more.</p>

<p class="indent">At the station we found the members of the
American Embassy Staff and some old Japanese
friends waiting to greet us. There were
nineteen in all on the Staff&mdash;a larger number
than at any other American Embassy. As we
walked down the platform to the carriage, the
photographers took flashlight pictures of the
party in quite an up-to-date American fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">We had a house ready for us on our arrival,
as the United States owns the Embassy in
Japan. Of course all our embassies and legations
and consulates are considered American
territory, but as almost all these are rented
houses, the theory is rather absurd. Years ago,
however, the Government felt that it was necessary
to buy land in Japan and Turkey for embassies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
and in China for a legation, and this
accounts for our experience.</p>

<p class="indent">Congress is not generous in anything which
does not concern immediate home politics. It
will not pay for embassies which compare with
those of other nations, as a rule. The one
appropriation so far suggested in Congress for
the purchase of five or six embassy buildings
is not sufficient to buy one suitable residence,
so the Government would probably acquire, at
best, only a second-rate house, which would
make the American Ambassador second-rate in
the eyes of the country to which he was accredited.</p>

<p class="indent">Granting that the Government did acquire a
suitable house, however, it would require an
increase in salary to keep it up. Diplomats are
obliged to observe certain standards of living
unless they wish to have their country looked
down upon. For instance, in Vienna even the
secretaries must drive in a carriage with a pair&mdash;a
one-horse conveyance is not considered
suitable for diplomats. On the other hand, as
there is no regular diplomatic service in America,
the raising of salaries would attract a poor
class of politicians who would seek foreign
posts for the money that went with them. This
happens sometimes in representations from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
other countries, but as they have a well-organized
service it does not occur very often.</p>

<p class="indent">From the outside the Embassy in Tokyo looks
rather like an American summer hotel&mdash;a
large white house with green blinds, of no particular
style and somewhat old and ramshackle.
I was told that it had to be built of wood on
account of earthquakes; it certainly had great
cracks in the walls. It had been newly painted
in honour of our arrival, and looked fairly well
on the outside, comparing favourably with some
of the other embassies: the English, German
and Austrian are perhaps better, and the
French are to build an ambitious new one. The
Dutch and the Brazilians were our nearest
diplomatic neighbours; the former have a very
nice compound on a hill near-by, and although
the house is not large it is filled with beautiful
curios. Our own Embassy was shabby,
but we found it rather nice and comfortable,
after all; it was one of the few houses in Tokyo
that had a furnace, which is a rare luxury in
Japan.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">
<a name="illo_081" id="illo_081"></a><img class="border" src="images/illo_081.jpg" width="700" height="450" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">THE AMERICAN EMBASSY, TOKYO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The embassies are scattered about on commanding
hills in different parts of the city, as
the land was bought at various times by their
respective governments. At one time Tsukiji
was the only part down by the river where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
foreigners who were not officials were allowed
to live, but I believe they may now rent houses
in any section of Tokyo.</p>

<p class="indent">Our compound was on the slope of a hill in
a district called Akasaka. It covered about two
acres and contained, besides the Embassy and
the chancery and the servants&#39; quarters connected
with it, a stable and two bungalows.
One of the bungalows was for the First Secretary,
the other for the First Japanese Secretary,
who was not a Japanese but an American
who had mastered the language.</p>

<p class="indent">The compound itself, in which all the buildings
stand, is really a garden, with cherries and
plums and twisted trees, an arbour of wisteria,
and, of course, a little pond and bridge. The
snow that came several times during the winter
only added to its charm, making of it a place
where sprites would have loved to dance.</p>

<p class="indent">The front door of the Embassy opened into
a large hall with a staircase at one side. On
the left was the Ambassador&#39;s private office,
which connected directly with the chancery offices,
while on the right was a small reception-room
with an open fire. I often received guests
in this room for tea; it was done in green and
had Japanese brasses and prints upon the walls.
Opening out of it was another small parlour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
done in pink and white, with rows of books
about; from this one entered a drawing-room
with red brocade on the walls, heavy furniture,
and a piano. This led in turn into a large
dining-room, finished in white, with an enclosed
veranda outside.</p>

<p class="indent">Up-stairs there were four bedrooms, a library,
and a long enclosed balcony into which the sun
poured all the morning. The bedrooms were
large and barn-like, but with the aid of Japanese
crêpes and rugs they came to look quite
attractive.</p>

<p class="indent">The place which I liked best of all was a
writing-room on the veranda. On a table covered
with a blue and white Chinese cloth stood
a small <i>hibachi</i>, a fire-box for warming the
hands, made of hammered brass, with fantastic
chrysanthemums and leaves. There were
also a long Korean pipe and a shorter Japanese
one, as well as a gun-metal box that we had
bought in Kyoto, inlaid with a crouching gold
tiger. On the wall were red and green prints.
Pottery and baskets with plants in them, and
a bowl of goldfish, completed the decorations
of this little den.</p>

<p class="indent">A few stray pieces of furniture, rather the
worse for wear, were the only things owned by
the Government, but we had arranged to rent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
the furnishings of my husband&#39;s predecessor.
Fortunately these were attractive things, so that
the house was ready for use upon our arrival.
It is much harder than one would imagine, even
to-day, to get things in Japan for European
houses. The foreign shops which had European
furniture to sell charged well for it, and
did not have much that was in good taste.</p>

<p class="indent">During the first few days we were busy unpacking
our belongings&mdash;some old Japanese
screens that had travelled round the world
back to Japan with us, a few rugs, and our
linen and silver. We weeded out the things we
did not especially care for in the house, and
picked up here and there some interesting
prints and curios. It was said to be the moment
to purchase porcelains that were coming out of
China, and as Jaehne, an American dealer in
Tokyo, came back with some good things, we
bought a few. With these, and with the enchanting
little dwarf trees in bloom, the Embassy
soon looked homelike and pretty.</p>

<p class="indent">We had already engaged in advance the Japanese
servants. These live in the Embassy
compound, and many of them are passed on
from one Ambassador to the next. Their quarters
are connected with the Embassy house, and
they sometimes invite their relations to live
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
with them, so that often fifty or more persons
may be found there. As they both eat and
sleep upon their mats and are very quiet, one
would never know they were in the compound
at all.</p>

<p class="indent">Watanabe and Dick, with the little maids,
all wore Japanese costumes. Watanabe, the
&quot;head boy,&quot; or butler, had been in the Embassy
for thirty-five years, and had entire
charge of the housekeeping arrangements. He
was head of the &quot;Boys&#39; Guild&quot; of Tokyo, and
an important person. Dick was the only one
of the servants who had been in America, although
the cook had been in France, and O
Sawa, the maid, had been to China and the
Philippines.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 451px;">
<a name="illo_087" id="illo_087"></a><img class="border" src="images/illo_087.jpg" width="451" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">JAPANESE SERVANTS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Every morning the cook sent up a French
menu for approval. European food, as prepared
by the Japanese, is really very good.
Turtle, served in American fashion, is quite as
palatable as our terrapin, and the &quot;mountain
whale,&quot; or wild boar, is a real delicacy. (In
olden times the Buddhists were not supposed
to eat meat, and because it was difficult for the
people of the mountains to get to the sea for
fish the priests allowed them to eat the wild
boar on the hills, but called it &quot;mountain
whale!&quot;) Some of the meat used in the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
comes from Australia, as does also the canned
butter. Cows are few, but we were able to
get our own milk and butter from a local dairy.
My husband is very fond of Japanese food, and
as I like it too, often of an evening when we
were alone or had friends who also enjoyed it,
we would have Japanese dinners at the Embassy,
served upon the table but in the pretty
lacquer bowls on little lacquer trays. Eels with
rice and <i>soy</i> was a favourite dish.</p>

<p class="indent">I used to enjoy sitting in the den and listening
to the street noises, they were so strange
and interesting. There were the songs of men
carrying heavy loads, and the bells of the men
who, in the winter, run from temple to temple,
almost naked, and have cold water poured over
them, as a penance. There was the fanfare
of the soldiers, too, something like that of the
Italians, and the flute of the blind masseur,
and the steady whistle of the man who cleans
the pipes of smokers. The newsboys all wore
bells, and the people selling wares often had
little drums which they beat.</p>

<p class="indent">When not listening to the sounds outside, I
often used to sit and look into the bowl of glistening
water where the goldfish lived, for they
quite fascinated me, with their jawless chins,
which they kept opening and shutting for food
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
in such a greedy manner! The swish of their
tails was like the grace of a trailing kimono
worn by the ladies of long ago, while their fins
suggested the sleeves of a <i>geisha</i> girl. Some
of them had popping eyes that stared at you,
some were so fat that they swam upside down
quite comfortably. They would rush from one
side of the bowl to the other, pushing their
noses up close against the glass, as if they were
eager to swim out of their lovely opalescent
world. Many humans live in a world not very
much larger than a goldfish&#39;s bowl, and never
try to get out at all!</p>

<p class="indent">Of an evening one heard the notes of the
<i>samisen</i>, an instrument like a small-headed
banjo, made of catskin and having three strings.
Japanese music is minor, and being in half
tones, which our ear is not trained to appreciate,
sounds very strange, and to many even
uncouth. None of it is written&mdash;the songs are
simply passed on from one to another. Although
so many Europeans do not care for
this music, I find it very fascinating.</p>

<p class="indent">But our ideas of what is beautiful are bound
to differ. Watanabe caught a nightingale in
the Embassy garden by means of a spider, and
put it in a cage in the house. It had several
notes, not all very pleasant, I must admit, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
I suppose it was a compliment when he told
some one, after having heard me sing, &quot;Bird&#39;s
high note just like Madam!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the silence of the night, one also heard
the clack, clack of the watchman at a house
near-by, who beat two sticks together so that
his master might hear and know that he was
keeping watch. Besides this, there was the
squeaking of rats, the meow of our cat, or the
barking of a dog. It must have been this same
dog, by the way, who came to such an untimely
end while we were there.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you heard the news?&quot; one of the
secretaries asked one morning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, no&mdash;what is it?&quot; I inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps you may remember that the Embassy
dog barked so much that our neighbours
complained and we had to give him away.
Some <i>geishas</i> took him, but he still came back
to visit us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; I interrupted, &quot;he comes back at
night&mdash;I&#39;ve heard him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He did come back&mdash;but alas! he never
will again. That is the news&mdash;we found him
dead in the garden this morning. His funeral
procession has just gone down the street, the
<i>geishas</i> following the corpse in their &#39;rickshas.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A dog&#39;s funeral! How funny!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
&quot;Not so funny as something that happened
not very long ago, when the local veterinary
died,&quot; the Secretary assured me; &quot;our Embassy
dog was invited to attend his funeral.
Of course we sent him, and he rode in state in
the first &#39;ricksha behind the body, followed by
other dogs of lesser rank, each riding in its
master&#39;s carriage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Occasionally there would be the tremor of
an earthquake. But most of the shocks are
slight&mdash;so slight that one doesn&#39;t often feel
them. Having been born and brought up on
made land in the Back Bay of Boston, where
every team shakes the house, I did not notice
one all the time I was in Tokyo. I had to take
the tremors on hearsay.</p>

<p class="indent">Tokyo is considered cold in winter. It has
a chill wind, but not so bad as the east wind in
Boston. The climate might, perhaps, compare
with Washington, but as the houses are so
lightly built, and the people live upon the floor
with little heat, the Japanese suffer a great deal
from the cold. It had always been thought
too severe in Tokyo for the Emperor, who as
Crown Prince used to go to the seashore during
the winter months, but this year, having become
Emperor on the death of his father, he
was obliged to stay in town.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
Miss Hyde has perhaps the most attractive
house and garden that I saw in Tokyo. The
garden was small, but you entered under a
<i>torii</i> gate, and found a bronze Buddha calmly
sitting beneath a tree. Indoors, Miss Hyde
had decorated some of the <i>shoji</i>, the sliding
screens, with pretty, laughing Japanese children.
Her wood cuts of these children, by the
way, are enchanting. The day we lunched with
her the table was charmingly arranged, with
little dolls among the flowers carrying lighted
egg-shell lanterns.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 452px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;SECRET.&quot;&mdash;WOOD-CUT BY MISS HYDE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The different members of the Staff were very
kind in welcoming us by dinners given in our
honour. Each entertainment had a new feature
introduced. Some of the &quot;boys&quot; are very
clever in arranging miniature landscapes on the
table, or dwarf box-gardens. Often electric
lights are introduced among the flowers. Japanese
fingers are so deft that the results are
marvellous. At one dinner to which we went,
the guests found little lanterns with their names
on them, and sat under a huge, wide-spread
Japanese umbrella. On many occasions the
place-cards were charmingly painted. One was
repeatedly fascinated by the fairy-like scenes
that were set on the tables. After dinner we
often had music or bridge&mdash;every Saturday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
night a certain set met for bridge at the Italian
Embassy, and on another evening at the Austrian.</p>

<p class="indent">One night, in the middle of a dinner, we heard
great shouting outside. It sounded like a college
cry in Japanese and ended up with &quot;<i>Banzai
Taishikwan</i>!&quot; The latter word means ambassador.
<i>Banzai</i> is often used as a toast&mdash;Good
luck to you!&mdash;but literally translated,
means, &quot;Hurrah! Ten thousand years!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At a dinner one evening, we met two Japanese
ladies, sisters, who were dressed alike in
black kimonos with white dots to represent a
snowstorm&mdash;a design especially appropriate
for winter; superb silver sashes embroidered
with black crows completed their costumes. At
this dinner an Italian tenor sang delightfully.
For souvenirs we were given charming lacquer
<i>saké</i> cups.</p>

<p class="indent">We ordered as mementoes for our dinners at
the Embassy small silver boxes with the American
eagle upon them. At Japanese dinners they
often give you exquisite lacquer cups or black
lacquer boxes with decorations in gold, tied
with bright cord, or silver knickknacks made in
artistic designs. They are sometimes put on
the table in their boxes in front of you, or
passed on a tray, uncovered, as is done at Court,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
at the end of the repast, so that you may pick
out the object you prefer. It was said that the
late Emperor himself used to design the tokens
which were used on the Imperial table. The
little souvenirs are admired and greatly treasured,
both by the Japanese themselves and by
foreigners, some of whom have really beautiful
collections which are displayed with pride on
the tables in their salons.</p>

<p class="indent">Shopping in Japan is always a leisurely affair.
It is fascinating to go into the queer,
pretty little shops with their soft mats, and to
enter the attractive courtyards. If the dealer
thinks you are sufficiently appreciative, he will
take out of his <i>godown</i> or treasure-house a blue
and white vase, or a peachblow, and will sit on
the mat handling it tenderly while you drink
a cup of tea or smoke a tiny pipe, as you choose.
One may spend days in such a curio shop, discussing
the beauty of a vase, admiring the
bronzes, and finally, perhaps, settling upon a
price! It is very exciting when the silken handkerchief
is being unwound from some treasure,
and you see the beautiful thing at last, for
you never can tell whether it is going to be a
little bronze or a piece of ivory, or smooth
lacquer. We knew enough to make the dealer
go deep into his <i>godown</i> before we began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
talk or bargain, for they don&#39;t trouble to bring
out their best things unless you insist. When
you have seen the really good work you wonder
how you ever looked at the <i>muki</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which
was displayed at first.</p>

Cheap articles made for foreign trade.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">After luncheon our drawing-room would
fairly seethe with dealers, who came to show
us their curios both old and new, which they
laid out on the furniture or the floor, as it happened.
They brought lacquer boxes and porcelains
to tempt the eye, and innumerable wood
cuts of doubtful quality.</p>

<p class="indent">Not only the old curios, but the modern
articles made for foreigners, are very attractive,
but dealers only make one or two of the
same kind, so it is often impossible to duplicate
even the simplest household things. Besides
the silver tea and coffee sets, there are silk
articles&mdash;stockings, handkerchiefs, and crêpes
of all kinds, beautifully embroidered&mdash;while
the modern porcelains are both charming and
cheap. But one finds most of these modern
things in America now. The old Japanese
curios that are really good cost more than ever,
and are every year more difficult to find.</p>

<p class="indent">The culture pearls are especially attractive,
and only the Japanese produce them. The oyster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
must be three years old when it is opened
and a piece of mother-of-pearl inserted. This
causes an irritation, which forms a pearl in
about four years. They are often coloured pink
or blue by injecting chemicals, but as they are
rather flat on one side they do not bring the
prices of natural pearls.</p>

<p class="indent">It is possible to buy some furs which are
rarely seen in America&mdash;the long-haired rabbit,
the badger, and slippers made of monkey-skin.
Wherever we went, we were advised to
buy our furs elsewhere. China is, of course,
noted for its skins&mdash;the long white goat and
the leopard being among the best&mdash;but we
were told not to buy in China because, although
furs were cheap there, they were not well cured.
In Russia we were warned not to buy them
because they were so costly, but to wait till we
reached Germany, where they are both well-cured
and inexpensive. I must confess that we
bought in all places, however, and found them
generally satisfactory. While the Japanese furs
are not so cheap as the Chinese, they are
cheaper than the Russian and are well cured.</p>

<p class="indent">The main shopping street of Tokyo, the
&quot;Ginza,&quot; is very broad and has the most prominent
stores. Some of these look quite as modern
as those on Broadway and are several stories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
high&mdash;a great contrast to the little wooden
houses about them. One finds to-day in the
city a great many wide spaces and parks that
did not exist a few years ago, but, of course,
many of the streets are still narrow and picturesque.</p>

<p class="indent">One lovely late afternoon, when there was a
silver half-moon swimming in the sky, I went
for a walk with Osame through the city streets,
which are a continuous bazaar. We turned
aside into little narrow ways, lined with bamboo
fences with quaint gates, inside of which
were glimpses of pretty gardens with gravel
approaches and gnarled pine-trees, and of little
houses with overhanging roofs that threatened
to tumble over with their own weight. In front
of the houses hung lanterns with characters
which Osame translated for me. Here was the
house of a &quot;Teacher of the Tea Ceremony,&quot;
there lived a &quot;Teacher of Flower Arrangement;&quot;
each tiny dwelling bore the name of its
owner&mdash;and often his telephone number!&mdash;on
a little wooden slab tacked on the gate-post. It
was all so typical and so characteristic&mdash;so
different from a street anywhere else in the
world. We came to a hill and passed up long
flights of steps, coming to a temple on the summit
which is as quiet and solemn as if it were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
miles from anywhere. Then we went down
again, by another long flight of stairs, into a
busy district, past many pretty tea-houses in
which <i>geishas</i> live, and so out into the more
respectable quarter of the Embassy. When my
husband was here twenty-five years ago, much
of this thickly settled part of the city was all
paddy-fields.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the signs on the streets, written in
English &quot;as it is Japped,&quot; used to be very
funny, but the Government has tried to do
away with the amusing ones, so that to-day they
are seldom seen in the city, though one runs
across them now and then in the country.
&quot;The efficacy of this beer is to give the health
and especially the strength for stomach. The
flavour is so sweet and simple in here if much
drink,&quot; was one of them, I remember. A tailor
of uniforms had on his sign, &quot;Gold Tail Shop,&quot;
while another shop assured the passer-by that
&quot;The tas [tea] are restful and for sharpen the
minds.&quot; Cigarettes are driving out the native
tobacco; a brand is advertised as being &quot;very
fragrant except a bad smell.&quot; One sign insisted
that within could be produced &quot;wine,
beer, and others!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The days at the Embassy passed very pleasantly.
Afternoons and evenings were filled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
with social duties, but the mornings I was free
to spend as I chose. Mrs. Caldwell, wife of one
of the Staff, and I found the Japanese toys
so fascinating that we could hardly tear ourselves
away from the shops. Madame Van
Royen, the American wife of the Dutch Minister,
and I had several automobile rides together.
Mrs. Caldwell and I played tennis and
sang duets, and sometimes of a morning I would
have a walk with one of the secretaries.</p>

<p class="indent">There was always plenty of sight-seeing to
be done whenever we had any spare time. It
was a happy surprise not to find more changes
in the outward appearance of the country and
of the people since my earlier visits. The hotels
throughout the country are more comfortable,
however, and the European food better. The
<i>naisans</i> (maids) and <i>geisha</i> girls speak a little
English now, which they could not do a few
years ago. In many of the towns the streets
are wider and are bright with electric lights,
while electric cars and motors are quite popular,
and even flying-machines are to be seen.
The cities are more sanitary than they were,
too, although even now an occasional case
of cholera is discovered, and foreigners are still
careful not to eat uncooked food.</p>

<p class="indent">The yellow journals of both America and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
Japan have been active in trying to stir up
trouble between the two countries. When we
were in Japan fifteen years ago, some of our
papers said that foreigners were in danger
there, but we never saw then, or while my husband
was Ambassador, any rudeness or threat
of violence. Lately, owing to the California
trouble, I understand that some rude speeches
have been made, and some writing has appeared
on the Embassy wall. When we were there
with the American Secretary of War on our
way to the Philippines, no people could have
showed greater good-will than the Japanese
Government expressed in every way to our
party, which represented the United States.</p>

<p class="indent">To return to the streets&mdash;although one sees
many carriages and a few motors, the man-drawn
jinrikisha is still the most popular conveyance;
a few years ago there were forty
thousand of them in Tokyo alone. The runners
can jog along at a good six miles an hour, and
can keep up the pace for a long distance. With
a leader or pusher, or with three men, as many
as ninety miles can be made in a day. As Tokyo
is almost as wide-spreading as London, an
automobile is a convenience in returning visits,
notwithstanding the narrowness of the streets,
in which people walk and children play. Pedestrians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
pay little attention to the warning of
the automobile horn, perhaps owing to the
whistles and horns of the dealers and the other
noises of the busy streets.</p>

<p class="indent">There are some large new brick buildings in
Tokyo, and a new railway station is being built.
Some of the European government buildings
are quite handsome, as well as very large and
imposing&mdash;they would look big anywhere,
whether one admired their architecture or not.
There are also two large European hotels, and
a good bank.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">SHIBA PARK, TOKYO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Shiba Park is not very far from the Embassy.
People go there to see the Shiba Temples,
which were built in honour of the sixth, seventh,
and ninth shoguns. As usual, one enters
through a <i>torii</i>, or gateway, into a paved courtyard,
and takes off one&#39;s shoes before going
into the temple.</p>

<p class="indent">In feudal times, when the Shogun came to
worship the spirits of his ancestors, he alone
ascended to the sanctum of the temple, the
<i>daimyos</i> seating themselves next to him in the
corridor below, while the rest of the nobility
occupied the oratory.</p>

<p class="indent">The lacquer in these temples is perhaps the
most beautiful that I saw in Japan, and the
carvings are superb. In many places one sees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
the three-leafed asarum, which is the crest of
the Tokugawa family, and the lotus, the Buddhist
emblem of purity.</p>

<p class="indent">Behind the temples are the stone tombs with
their bronze lanterns; the newest one bears the
date 1877, and is the burial place of the present
Emperor&#39;s great-aunt. Near the tombs can be
seen the imprint of Buddha&#39;s feet, which must
have been of phenomenal size!</p>

<p class="indent">One day we went over the Osaka Museum,
which has probably more Buddhas than any
other museum in the world. It is a private collection
near the Embassy, and contains some
superb red lacquers, all very well arranged. It
was interesting to note that the porcelains
were tied to the shelves, on account of earthquakes.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the most popular resorts, Uyeno Park,
which is well known for its temples and the
tombs of the shoguns, is on very high ground
and has a fine view. An immense stone lantern&mdash;one
of the three largest in Japan&mdash;is there,
and also an ancient pagoda and some fine cryptomerias.
During the season people visit this
park in hundreds to see the cherry blossoms.</p>

<p class="indent">The tombs of the Forty-Seven Ronins must
be visited, so much has been written about the
brave band, and their dramatic story is so often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
told in Japan. Under the huge cryptomerias on
the side of a hill, one comes to the many stone
lanterns surrounding a sort of court, where
their admirers still place lighted incense sticks
and leave their visiting cards on the dead
heroes. By the path leading to the tombs the
well where the Ronins washed the head of their
victim still exists.</p>

<p class="indent">Briefly told, their story is as follows: In
April of the year 1701, Asano, Lord of Ako,
while in Tokyo with the Shogun, was asked to
arrange one of the great State ceremonies.
Now, Asano was a warrior, and knew little of
such matters, so he questioned a nobleman
named Kira, who was well versed in Court etiquette.
It did not occur to Asano that he was
expected to pay for the information, and when
he failed to do so, Kira jeered at him, and one
day insulted him by asking him to fasten his
<i>tabi</i>, or footgear. Stirred to anger, Asano drew
his sword and slashed the nobleman, without,
however, killing him.</p>

<p class="indent">Unfortunately, this happened in the palace
grounds. To fight in such a sacred place is a
crime, and Asano was told that as a punishment
he must perform <i>hara-kiri</i>, which he immediately
did. Asano&#39;s castle was confiscated and
his family declared extinct, so that his faithful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
retainers became <i>ronin</i>, or &quot;wave men&quot;&mdash;wanderers.</p>

<p class="indent">Oishi, the head retainer, consulted with forty-six
of the most trusted of the band, and they
swore vengeance on Kira, who had brought
about their master&#39;s death. In time the forty-six
became trades-people, while Oishi himself
pretended dissipation in order to put Kira off
the track. But they did not forget their oath
of vengeance, and two years later, during a
severe snowstorm, the Forty-Seven Ronins
made an attack upon Kira and his retainers,
and succeeded in vanquishing them.</p>

<p class="indent">As Kira was a great noble, he was given the
privilege of performing <i>hara-kiri</i>, but he was
afraid to kill himself, and so Oishi murdered
him. As the Forty-Seven Ronins marched
through the streets with the head of their
enemy, the people came out of their houses and
cheered. Oishi laid Kira&#39;s head upon the grave
of Asano. Official sentence condemned all the
Ronins to commit <i>hara-kiri</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and they have been
worshipped as heroes ever since.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_3_3">
<span class="label">[3]</span></a>
<i>Hara-kiri</i> is an honourable form of capital punishment,
is also a popular method of suicide. The man who is about to
die invites his friends to share in a farewell feast. Robed in
white, he takes leave of them and enters a screened enclosure,
where he proceeds to disembowel himself with a knife. A friend
who acts as a sort of second stands by and with a keen sword
puts an end to his agony by cutting off his head.</p>

<h2><a name="chIV" id="chIV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="h3">COURT FUNCTIONS</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illo_110.jpg" width="100" height="111" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NATURALLY, the most interesting
event of the winter was our audience
and luncheon at Court. We
started from the Embassy at half-past
ten in the morning. My husband was accompanied
by his immediate Staff, in full evening
dress, and all wearing mourning bands on their
arms&mdash;the Naval and Military Attachés, of
course, were in full-dress uniform. L. went off
in a State carriage of gold and black, sent by
the Emperor, with a Court dignitary to conduct
him to the palace, and an escort of the Imperial
Lancers on horseback, bearing pennants of red
and white, the Imperial colours. Court carriages
with the Secretaries and Attachés were
next in line, each one having a coachman with
cockade and golden bands on hat and livery,
and two <i>bettos</i>, or running footmen.</p>

<p class="indent">I followed this procession in the Embassy
carriage, with the Naval and Military Attachés&#39;
wives in other vehicles behind. The coachman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
and the <i>betto</i> of the American Embassy presented
quite a fine appearance in their characteristic
livery&mdash;navy-blue hats, mushroom-shaped
and bearing the eagle, and coats to
match, with shoulder capes piped with red,
white and blue.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">
<a name="illo_111" id="illo_111"></a><img class="border" src="images/illo_111.jpg" width="700" height="539" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">THE COACHMAN AND THE <i>BETTO</i> OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">So we started on that wonderful drive
through Tokyo. Down the steep descent from
the quaint, lovely garden of the Embassy we
drove, the <i>bettos</i> holding back on the poles to
help the under-sized little horses. Two mounted
soldiers fell in behind the official carriages as
we passed down the broad streets. The <i>bettos</i>
ran on ahead, and shouted out warnings to the
pedestrians, who always fill the roadways where
they are narrow, and scatter over them where
they are broad. Men and women stood still
and faced the Imperial carriage as it passed,
uncovering their heads, and some even prostrating
themselves on the ground; others came
out from the miniature shops to gaze; jinrikishas
and trolley-cars stopped, and people got
out of them and stood respectfully; the tiny
dolls of children even looked on in wonder, and
the police stood at attention at the corners.
For we were going to see the mysterious Mikado,
Son of Heaven, Heir of Two Thousand
and Five Hundred Years of Direct Descent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
from the Sun-Goddess. Hidden away there
in his palace behind the ramparts and moats
of ancient castles, strange and far away, he is
still held sacred by his millions of people!</p>

<p class="indent">Every view was like a picture on a fan. We
went on past the walled residences of ancient
feudal lords; past the <i>torii</i>&mdash;the &quot;bird-rest&quot;
gates at temple entrances&mdash;through which we
caught glimpses of stone lanterns and the wide-open
fronts of picturesque shrines. Again we
passed tea-houses from which the twang of
<i>samisen</i> was heard; and left behind us rows
on rows of shops with wares of every kind
exposed in front for trade. Everywhere the
men and quaint little women went stumbling
along on their clicking clogs, bowing low to
one another; and every moment through some
opening of wall or entrance we could see delightful
little gardens of tree and stone and water
arranged in a way both fascinating and fanciful.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">
<a name="illo_115" id="illo_115"></a><img class="border" src="images/illo_115.jpg" width="700" height="451" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">THE MOATS, IMPERIAL CASTLE, TOKYO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">We came to the broad expanse before the first
moat of the Imperial castle. Beyond rose the
great stone wall, grey, moss-grown and impressive,
of huge blocks like those of the Egyptian
pyramids. The branches of the grotesque overhanging
pine-trees bowed down to the still
waters beneath, where the lovely lotus opens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
up its flowers in season and the great leaves lie
idly on the smooth surface. At the corners of
the wall rose the white, many-storied guardhouses,
like pagodas with their curving roofs.
We passed through the huge gateway with its
heavy doors into a second wide space, which
led to another moat and rampart of the ancient
castle fortifications, crossed another bridge, and
entered the sacred enclosure of the Imperial
residence, with its imposing gate; and finally
wound round a gravel road, bordered with great
trees, to the palace entrance, a large covered
porch, from which steps led toward the reception
hall. On each side stretched the palace,
built in old Japanese style, low and simple, in
its wood colour and white.</p>

<p class="indent">Count Toda, Grand Master of Ceremonies,
Count Watanabe, Minister of the Imperial
Household, the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
and other officials and chamberlains met us at
the entrance. With little delay the bowing
officials conducted the party through long corridors,
laid with red carpets. Here more officials
in gold-braided European dress were stationed
at intervals. From the corridors we
caught delightful glimpses of large rooms with
gorgeous decoration, and enjoyed the odour of
perfumed woods. The ladies were left in one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
reception-room and the men gathered in another.</p>

<p class="indent">My husband was conducted alone to the Ph&oelig;nix
Hall, where he was to be received in audience
by the Emperor. Taking a few steps along
the gallery, which looked out into another delightful
garden, he faced into a square, simple
Japanese room, in the middle of which stood
His Imperial Majesty, with his interpreter beside
him, while at a distance behind and on
either side were gentlemen-in-waiting. Etiquette
required a low bow at the threshold and
two others while approaching. The Emperor
extended his hand, and made some inquiries
through his interpreter. L. read a short
speech, which was afterward translated by
the interpreter, and handed his credentials
and the letter of recall of his predecessor to
the Emperor, who passed them to an aide at
one side, and replied in a very low voice through
the interpreter with a few words of welcome
and assurances of the maintenance of happy
relations. Then it was indicated that the Staff
might be presented. They entered, making
their three bows as they approached the Emperor,
who shook the hand of each one, then
they retired backward out of the room. After
they had disappeared, His Majesty again gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
his hand in token that the audience was over,
and my husband made his bows and withdrew.</p>

<p class="indent">After this he joined me, and we were both
received by the Empress in the Peony Hall,
a small room with hardwood floors, wood carvings,
beautifully decorated walls and ceiling,
but no furniture. I followed L., courtesying
at the door as he bowed, and again as the
Empress gave me her hand. The ladies with
me followed in our train, also courtesying.</p>

<p class="indent">Her Majesty talked through an interpreter,
the conversation consisting principally of questions,
such as&mdash;&quot;How did you stand the journey
across Siberia?&quot; &quot;Do you not find it very
cold in Japan?&quot; &quot;Do you enjoy flowers?&quot;
The Empress is young, bright and very pretty.
She was dressed in deep mourning, in European
style, and her hair was done in the Western
fashion. After she had spoken a few words to
each one of us we courtesied and backed to the
door. Their Majesties were kind enough to say
they remembered us from our former luncheon
at the palace during the reign of the late Emperor.</p>

<p class="indent">In the interval between the audience and
the luncheon, the latter not occurring till half-past
twelve, we drove back to the Embassy.
Our &quot;head boy&quot; told us it was customary to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
have a glass of champagne upon returning from
such a function, so we had some wine and biscuit,
which the Master of Ceremonies and the
officer in command of the escort were invited
to share with us. Then we all went out and
were photographed by all kinds of cameras
levelled by an army of photographers&mdash;as that
seemed to be the custom, too.</p>

<p class="indent">When we returned to the palace, we were conducted
into the vast Room of One Thousand
Seeds, which, like the Peony Hall, had no chairs;
but the ceiling was magnificently carved and
there were beautiful panels and vases of flowers.
Different members of the Imperial family came
in, the men in uniform, the ladies in black European
gowns and hats. As the luncheon was
to be informal, frock coats were worn by the
men of the Embassy in place of evening clothes.
I was then presented to the Emperor, who was
in khaki uniform, and seemed alert and interested
in everything, and we followed Their
Majesties into the large dining-room near-by.</p>

<p class="indent">This room was also vast and spacious, with
glass on one side through which we looked out
into the garden. The table was set in handsome
European style for thirty or forty persons, and
a number of servants in European liveries stood
in impressive line behind. Their Majesties sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
together in the centre of the table, with Prince
and Princess Kan-in on their right and left.</p>

<p class="indent">Prince Kan-in, who was on one side of me,
is a cousin of the Emperor, young and quite
good looking. Having lived in France for nine
years, he spoke French well. On the other side
was Prince Katsura, who was at that time
Prime Minister and one of the strongest and
best-known men in Japan. Prince Katsura
spoke a little English, but preferred German.
His German was not much better than mine,
so we did not have so much interesting conversation
as we otherwise might have had.
Prince Fushimi, now quite an old man, whom
we had met years ago in Boston, was there,
besides many others.</p>

<p class="indent">The luncheon was in European style and
delicious. The table ornaments were exquisite
orchids in silver dishes. During the meal the
Emperor sent me several messages through one
of the gentlemen-in-waiting, who acted as interpreter:
&quot;Do you have orchids in America?&quot;
&quot;Are you going to Nikko this summer!&quot; To
my answer that I had been at Nikko, His Majesty
replied, that his Summer Palace was at
Nikko, and that he hoped we might go there
again, as he felt sure we would each time see
even more beautiful things. The Emperor proposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
my husband&#39;s health by lifting his glass
and drinking, and L. rose, lifted his, and drank
to the Emperor. Then His Majesty pledged
me, and I rose, and drank to him in return.
At the close of the luncheon charming silver
bonbon boxes in old Japanese designs, such as
the <i>hibachi</i> and the <i>kago</i>, or sedan-chair, and
bearing the Imperial crest, were offered us as
souvenirs. We were each delighted to select
one of these attractive mementoes.</p>

<p class="indent">After luncheon we returned again to the Hall
of One Thousand Seeds, followed by the high
officials of the Imperial Household. Here my
husband and I conversed more intimately with
Their Majesties. Conversation was carried on
in a whisper through the interpreter, for Japanese
Court etiquette requires that the voice be
never raised while talking with the Emperor
and Empress. Then the Imperial party withdrew,
and the rest of us were left to pass out
at leisure and view with interest and pleasure
the rooms through which we were conducted,
visiting the large, simple Throne Room on the
way. So this extraordinary experience came to
an end, and remains a dream, wonderful, seemingly
unreal. The day after the audience we
went over to the palace, and signed our names
in the Imperial books.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
The reigning Emperor is the one hundred and
twenty-fourth of his line. It is said that he
wishes to travel beyond his kingdom, but although
the Japanese people themselves seek to
be up to date and familiar with the ways of the
Western world, many of them do not wish their
ruler to be so, and therefore do not quite approve
of his taking so much interest in foreigners.
In his boyhood the Emperor went to school
and seemed quite well and strong; it is said,
however, that he is rather delicate now. Even
then he was astonishingly democratic in his
ideas. They tell a story that, when a boy, while
out driving one day, he saw a man on the corner
of a street selling cookies, and said that he
wished to have some. Other cookies were made
like them and given to him, but he refused them.
Nothing would do but he must have those sold
by the old man on the corner. In vain the
attendants argued that those cookies were only
made for common people, for human beings&mdash;members
of the Imperial family are supposed
to be divine&mdash;the boy said that if human beings
and the common people could eat them, he could
eat them, too. So the cakes were finally bought,
and no doubt he enjoyed them.</p>

<p class="indent">The beautiful new palace on the edge of the
city, at Akasaka, is a fine building in good European
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
style, much like the palace in Brussels.
Here the garden parties take place. The present
Emperor has never lived in it, preferring
his Japanese palace on the same grounds,
which he considers more wholesome, and where
he lived as Crown Prince. Audiences are still
held, as in his father&#39;s time, in the old palace,
which has been done over somewhat since the
death of the late Emperor.</p>

<p class="indent">After our audience and luncheon at Court, we
were received also by several of the Imperial
Princes and Princesses at their palaces. To
these visits we went in our own automobile, our
chauffeur and footman wearing caps with the
American eagle and gold braid on the visor,
and little shoulder-straps of gold that made
them look suitably ambassadorial. Sometimes
we took Osame on the box instead of the footman,
so that he might straighten matters out
in case of difficulty, as the footman and the
chauffeur did not speak a word but Japanese.
In his frock coat and top hat he looked quite
properly funereal. My husband went in his
evening dress, and I wore black. The houses
were usually quite European, but were somewhat
bare inside, with a little old-fashioned
European furniture. As we entered, we were
greeted by several officials-in-waiting in fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
uniforms, and then were almost immediately
received, quite in the same fashion as by the
Emperor and Empress, except that we were
asked to sit down.</p>

<p class="indent">One day the Prince and Princess Kan-in received
us. The Nagasakis were in attendance
and acted as interpreters. They spoke excellent
English. We had known them before, and
had found them especially agreeable. Mr. Nagasaki
is Court Councillor and Master of Ceremonies,
as well as Lord Steward to His Imperial
Highness, Prince Kan-in. Prince Kan-in&#39;s
palace is a large modern house with fine
grounds, surrounded by a splendid old-fashioned
wall and entered by a great old-time gate.
It was rather cold and bare inside, but the Aide
and the Master of Ceremonies in their gold
regalia gave bright touches of colour.</p>

<p class="indent">The second princess who received us was the
wife of Prince Asaka and daughter of the late
Emperor. Again the officer in attendance had
been educated in England and was a man of
the world. As at Court, the women were in
European dress and in deep mourning with jet
jewelry. The conversation, as usual, was more
or less about flowers, the weather and the journey.</p>

<p class="indent">Later, we were received at Prince Higashi
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
Fushimi&#39;s, whose house we found Japanese in
style and especially charming. The room where
we were received, however, had been arranged
for the comfort of foreigners, as it contained
a sofa, a table and chairs. Prince Fushimi, who
is an admiral in the navy, was in London with
the Princess at the time of the Coronation.
Both spoke English very well. A card was sent
to us as a return visit within half an hour after
each diplomatic audience, as is required by
Japanese etiquette.</p>

<p class="indent">An important function, which the Diplomatic
Corps missed on account of the mourning for
the late Emperor, was the New Year reception
at Court. At this the ladies wear beautiful long
court trains hung from the shoulders, such as
are worn at the Court of St. James. I was told
that the diplomats are first conducted to the
Throne Room, a large hall, where two chairs
are arranged upon a raised dais, much as at
European courts. Here they march in the precedence
of embassies and legations past the
Emperor and Empress on their thrones, then
past all the Imperial Highnesses, bowing and
courtesying to each one. After this, in a
smaller room they are served with tea, coffee
and cakes, and receive lovely gifts as souvenirs.
Finally, in still another room, they are received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
by Their Majesties and the other Imperial personages
in a more special way.</p>

<p class="indent">Among Court recreations in which the Diplomatic
Corps are invited to join, is the Imperial
duck-catching party, held in gardens near Tokyo
in the spring. By decoy ducks the wild
birds are lured into little canals, on either side
of which stand those who take part in the sport,
holding large nets with long handles high in
the air. All are silent and alert, and as soon
as a duck takes flight, the netter dashes forward
and, if expert, entangles a bird in the net. This
sport is a combination of snaring and hawking,
for if a bird escapes the hunter, it is likely to
be killed by the hawk chained to the hunter&#39;s
wrist, which is then set free. Afterward luncheon
is served, a delicious duck stew being the
principal feature, and the guests return home
laden with the birds they have succeeded in
catching.</p>

<p class="indent">The official celebration of the Emperor&#39;s
birthday includes several imposing Court functions.
When my husband was in Japan in 1889,
earthquakes, reviews and events of all kinds
were provided for His Imperial Majesty&#39;s
thirty-sixth anniversary. First, they were
treated to three seismic shocks within twenty-four
hours, and of quite perceptible violence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
Then there was the Grand Review of troops
by the Emperor at the cheerful hour of half
after eight in the morning.</p>

<p class="indent">My husband thus describes it: &quot;Aoyama,
the &#39;Champ de Mars&#39; of Tokyo, is a tremendously
large parade ground, which was simply
walled in by the mass of plebeians that had
turned out to do honour to the occasion. For
the foreigners the &#39;high seats&#39; had been reserved
in the diplomatic tent next to the Imperial
stand. The Emperor, followed by the
Lancers and a gorgeous Staff, made a tour of
the field, and then the troops passed in review
before him. They were about ten thousand in
number, and made a really excellent appearance;
the marching and order were good,
at times very good. The cavalry appeared
rather awkward, but this was due to the
brutish little horses more than anything
else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the evening there was the grand ball at
the &#39;Rokumeikan,&#39; given by Count Okuma, then
Minister of Foreign Affairs, in honour of the
Emperor&#39;s anniversary, which starts the social
whirl of the capital for the season. It was an
elegant affair, and from the good taste and
good management, it might well have been
in Paris. The grounds were beautifully decorated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
with lanterns and coloured lights, and the
building was superb inside with bunting and
flowers, the national chrysanthemum being used
with excellent effect. The uniforms and decorations
of the guests added brilliancy and movement.
There were almost as many foreigners
as Japanese, and nearly all the latter were in
European dress, only a few ladies wearing the
native costume. Those in European gowns carried
them off exceedingly well, and danced
waltzes and quadrilles in most approved Western
manner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The present Emperor&#39;s anniversary, as I
have learned from a letter, was celebrated in
1913 in much the same way as his predecessor&#39;s
more than twenty years ago&mdash;with one important
exception, the three earthquake shocks
were omitted! The day began with the review
of the soldiers at Aoyama, after which congratulatory
poems were presented to His Majesty
by the Empress and the Empress Dowager.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
The Emperor then received the Imperial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
Princes and Princesses, and entertained them
at luncheon.</p>

The Dowager Empress of Japan died of heart disease at
the Imperial Villa Nowazu, April 9th, 1914. She was the
widow of Emperor Mutsuhito, who died July 30th, 1912. The
Empress Dowager was born May 28th, 1858, and was married
to the late Emperor in 1869. She was the daughter of a nobleman,
Icliejo-Tadado, and was greatly beloved by the Japanese
people.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The birthday dinner in the evening was followed
by the ball given by the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, Baron Makino, at his official residence.
Here were princesses of the blood in
white gowns and superb jewels, Japanese ladies
in kimonos, ladies of the Corps Diplomatique
in European costume, priests in their varied
robes, and diplomats and attaches in gorgeous
uniforms. It was a brilliant scene. The rooms
were lighted by electricity and decorated with
a profusion of chrysanthemums and the Imperial
crest in gold. Long clusters of wisteria
depending from the ceiling sparkled with electric
bulbs, and in the supper-room the guests
were seated at tables under the branches of
artificial cherry-trees blossoming in the Emperor&#39;s
honour.</p>

<p class="indent">Some account of our previous reception at
Court by the late Emperor and Empress may
be of interest. It took place when we passed
through Japan in the company of the American
Secretary of War, Mr. Dickinson, on the way
to the Philippines in 1910. At that time we
crossed the Pacific to the Land of the Rising
Sun.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">THE LATE EMPEROR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">News had been received while at sea by aerogram
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
from the Embassy that the Imperial Mikado
and the Empress would grant an audience
and entertain at luncheon at the palace, but
there was much doubt as to what this really
meant, for the audience might be only for the
Secretary and Mrs. Dickinson. So the pleasure
and surprise were all the greater when, on
arrival, it was found that those accompanying
the Secretary were to be included in both functions.</p>

<p class="indent">The invitations, in Japanese characters, were
handed to us with many others on our arrival,
but had already been formally answered at the
American Embassy. The instructions were the
same then as they are to-day as to costume and
etiquette. They indicated that the ladies were
to wear high-necked dresses with trains and
hats, and the men were to be in uniform or full
dress. On the morning of the sixteenth (of
July), we all met at the Embassy at eleven
o&#39;clock&mdash;as the audience was due at noon&mdash;and
placed ourselves in the hands of the Ambassador.</p>

<p class="indent">Two Imperial carriages conveyed the important
official members of the party to the palace,
and the rest proceeded in vehicles hired for the
occasion.</p>

<p class="indent">After the men of the party were presented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
to the Emperor, in the manner already described,
they rejoined the ladies, and all were
introduced to the lady-in-waiting, Countess
Kagawa, and then conducted to Her Majesty&#39;s
audience hall. Mrs. O&#39;Brien, the wife of the
Ambassador, preceded, making low courtesies;
the ladies followed.</p>

<p class="indent">The Emperor, who was in uniform, appeared
older than we had expected. Her Majesty was
several years older than the Emperor, and had
charming manners, but she did not smile. Expression,
we were informed, is not considered
aristocratic. Her hair and dress were in European
fashion, and she wore beautiful pearls.
She had no children&mdash;the present Mikado is
the only son of Emperor Meiji by another
wife.</p>

<p class="indent">Some stories that are told of the late Emperor
show how much real strength of character
he possessed. A few years ago, it is said, when
a plot against His Majesty&#39;s life was discovered,
the Prime Minister went to him and offered
his resignation, saying that as this plot
had been brought to light while he was in office
(the first plot against any Mikado in the history
of Japan), he felt that perhaps his administration
had not been good. The Emperor, however,
would not accept his resignation, saying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
that if the people wished to take his life, it must
be his fault&mdash;it must show that he had not been
a good ruler. Accordingly, he ordered only
twelve of the twenty-four offenders to be put
to death.</p>

<p class="indent">In his last illness, owing to the old belief
that his person was too sacred to be touched,
even the doctors were not allowed to come in
contact with him, his pulse being counted by
a silken cord about his wrist. The Empress
was at his bedside when he died. The only
person who ever entered his apartment, I was
told, was Prince Ito, who came on some urgent
affair of state in response to a telephone
message from the Emperor himself. The Prince
was admitted before the Mikado was dressed
in the morning. Even on the greatest occasions,
however, he was never really well dressed, because
no one was permitted to fit his clothes,
lest a mere human being should touch his person.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet the life of the late Emperor, secluded
though he was within his palace walls, was freedom
itself in comparison with that of the ancient
rulers. In olden times, so Hearn writes,
&quot;His (the Mikado&#39;s) feet were never permitted
to touch the ground out of doors, nor was he
allowed to cut his hair, beard or nails, or to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
expose himself to the rays of the sun.&quot; His
only excursions outside the walls of his palace
were made in a large <i>norimono</i>, or palanquin,
borne by fourteen men, in which, behind the latticed
windows, he was able to catch glimpses of
the outer world while himself invisible. Even
if he granted an audience, he was never seen,
his person being completely hidden by bamboo
screens.</p>

<p class="indent">The emperors of ancient days were allowed
to have three consorts besides the Empress, also
nine maids of high rank and twenty-seven maids
of lower rank, all of whom were known as wives.
In addition to these, he was at liberty to have
eighty-one concubines. Only one of the wives
ranked as empress, but the twelve next below
her had each a palace near that of the Emperor.
By way of contrast, it is said that the present
Emperor has never loved any woman but the
Empress. The Mikado&#39;s eldest daughter was
in olden times appointed chief priestess of the
Temple of the Sun, at Ise.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Somewhat in contrast with my husband&#39;s experiences
were those of America&#39;s first Ambassador
to Japan, Mr. Townsend Harris, as he
has related them in his journal. After his
arrival in Japan and many weary months of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
waiting at Shimoda, he wrote September 25th,
1857, &quot;I am to go to Yedo (now Tokyo) in the
most honourable manner; and after my arrival
I am to have an audience of the Shogun, and
then present the letter of the President!!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The manner in which I am to salute the
Shogun,&quot; he adds, &quot;is to be the same as in
the courts of Europe, that is, three bows. They
made a faint request that I would prostrate
myself and &#39;knock-head,&#39; but I told them the
mentioning such a thing was offensive to
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After two months spent in preparation for
the journey, Mr. Harris with an imposing retinue
started for Yedo, about one hundred miles
away.</p>

<p class="indent">As a part of the preparation for his journey,
&quot;Bridges had been built over every stream,&quot;
he tells us, &quot;the pathway mended, and all the
bushes cut away so as to leave the path clear.&quot;
At one place the road had actually been <i>swept</i>
only a few hours before the procession passed
over it. All along the way the people stood
motionless in front of their houses, and all the
shops but the cook shops were closed. The
magistrates of each village conducted Mr. Harris
to the borders of the next, prostrating themselves
in salute as they left. The Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
had also ordered that there should be no travel
over the Tokaido, the Eastern Sea Road, during
his journey.</p>

<p class="indent">In Yedo the American Envoy was domiciled
in the &quot;Court&quot; section of the city, and eight
<i>daimyos</i> were appointed as &quot;Commissioners
of the voyage of the American Ambassador to
Yedo.&quot; Another week was passed in receiving
and paying visits of ceremony, and in arranging
matters of detail. Mr. Harris received as a
present from the Shogun seventy pounds of
Japanese bonbons beautifully arranged in four
trays.</p>

<p class="indent">On December 7th, at ten o&#39;clock in the morning,
our Ambassador set out for his audience
of the Shogun. &quot;My dress,&quot; he says, &quot;was
a coat embroidered with gold after the pattern
furnished by the State Department, blue pantaloons
with a broad gold band running down
each leg, cocked hat with gold tassels, and a
pearl-handled dress sword.&quot; He was escorted
by the same retinue that he had had during the
journey. He was carried in his <i>norimono</i> up
to the last bridge in front of the audience hall,
and before entering this building he put on a
new pair of patent leather shoes. The Japanese,
of course, went in their <i>tabis</i>. After a
time he was led to the audience hall, past a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
number of <i>daimyos</i>, seated in Japanese fashion,
who saluted by touching their foreheads to the
mat. The Prince of Shinano, Master of Ceremonies,
then threw himself on his hands and
knees, and Mr. Harris stood behind him, with
Mr. Heusken in the rear bearing the President&#39;s
letter.</p>

<p class="indent">At a given signal, the Prince crawled forward
on hands and knees, and as Mr. Harris followed
and entered the hall of audience, a chamberlain
called out, &quot;Embassador Merican!&quot; With
the prescribed three bows at intervals, he advanced
toward the throne, before which the
members of the Great Council lay prostrate on
their faces. Pausing a few seconds, Mr. Harris
then addressed the Tai-kun&mdash;as he had been
instructed to call the Shogun&mdash;expressing the
good wishes of the President.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After a short silence,&quot; says Mr. Harris,
&quot;the Tai-kun began to jerk his head backward
over his left shoulder, at the same time stamping
with his right foot. This was repeated
three or four times.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> After this he spoke audibly
and in a pleasant and firm voice,&quot; expressing
his pleasure in the Ambassador&#39;s speech,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
and graciously adding, &quot;Intercourse shall be
continued for ever.&quot;</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_5_5">
<span class="label">[5]</span></a>
I have been told that Mr. Harris <i>shouted</i> in delivering his
address to the Shogun, who, perhaps, had never before heard anyone
speak above a whisper.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Mr. Harris then presented the President&#39;s
letter, after which he withdrew, as he had entered,
with three bows.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Harris&#39; description of the Shogun himself
is of interest: &quot;The Tai-kun was seated
in a chair placed on a platform raised about
two feet from the floor, and from the ceiling in
front of him a grass curtain was hung; when
unrolled, it would reach the floor, but it was
now rolled up, and was kept in its place by large
silk cords with heavy tassels. By an error in
their calculation, the curtain was not rolled up
high enough to enable me to see his headdress,
as the roll formed by the curtain cut through
the centre of his forehead, so that I cannot fully
describe his &#39;crown,&#39; as the Japanese called
it. The dress of the Tai-kun was made of silk,
and the material had some little gold wove in
with it, but it was as distant from anything
like regal splendour as could be conceived; no
rich jewels, no elaborate gold ornaments; no
diamond-hilted weapon appeared.... The Japanese
told me his crown is a black lacquered
cap, of an inverted bell shape.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two years later Mr. Heusken, Mr. Harris&#39;
secretary, was assassinated, and his own house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
was burned. But Mr. Harris never wavered.
Dignified, firm, self-respecting, he was always
the kind, patient teacher of the Japanese in the
ways of the outside world, winning from them
the title which they love to give him&mdash;&quot;the
nation&#39;s friend.&quot; He was a great diplomat,
but his was a strikingly human and Christian
diplomacy. He laid the foundations for America&#39;s
subsequent dealings with Japan so deep
in the bedrock of justice and mutual forbearance
that the superstructure has never yet been
shaken. Our own personal experiences were
pleasanter because Townsend Harris had led
the way.</p>

<p class="h3">LIFE IN TOKYO</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illo_142.jpg" width="100" height="114" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OUR diplomatic visits were made within
two days of our arrival, as etiquette
requires. My first visit was on the
Doyenne of the Diplomatic Corps,
Marchesa Guiccioli. The French Ambassador
was Doyen, but as he was not married the Italian
Ambassadress was the first lady of the
Corps. When our diplomatic calls had been
made and returned, we returned those made
by the American colony in Tokyo and Yokohama.</p>

<p class="indent">During the winter the ladies of the Diplomatic
Corps decided to have a day &quot;at home&quot;
each week. The period of second mourning for
the late Emperor had begun, and we all dressed
in black and white. Dinners and calling
among the diplomats continued, but the official
dinners between the Japanese and the foreigners
did not take place on account of the
mourning.</p>

<p class="indent">The diplomatic dinners were always large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
affairs of twenty or thirty people, and quite
formal, with the host and hostess sitting in
foreign fashion at the centre of the table, the
ends filled in with young secretaries. There
were but few women present, for many of the
diplomats in Tokyo were not married. Occasionally
we found one or two Japanese at these
dinners, but not often, owing to the official
mourning. They might have been given in
Europe or anywhere, except for a touch of
the East in the costumes of the servants and
the curios about the house.</p>

<p class="indent">To show how a Japanese lady or gentleman
answers an Ambassador&#39;s invitation, I give
literal translations of two responses which are
quite typical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="space-above">&quot;<span class="smcap">Worshipfully Addressed.</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Having received upon my head
the honourable loving invitation of the
coming 25th day, I humbly regard it
as the extremity of glory. Referring
thereto, in the case of the rustic wife
there being unavoidably a previous engagement,
although with regret, (she)
is humbly unable to ascend; consequently
the little student one person,
humbly accepting, will go to the honourable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
residence. Rapidly, rapidly,
worshipfully bowing.</p>

However, in the matter of &mdash;&mdash;, although
regretting, (he) humbly declines.

to decline. It is honourably thus. Respectfully
bowing.</p>

<p>&quot;Second moon, 20th day.<br />
American Ambassador, Mr. Anderson,<br />
Beneath the Mansion.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Our first reception was attended by most of
the diplomats, some of the American colony,
and a few Japanese. In American fashion I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
had the ladies of the Embassy pour tea at the
large table in the dining-room. There were
over a hundred and fifty guests in all, many
coming from Yokohama. On another of our
days at home a huge shipload of tourists from
the <i>Cleveland</i> arrived, which made the afternoon
quite gay. They began to arrive half an
hour before time, much to their dismay. It
seems that they had been put into &#39;rickshas
and their coolies instructed to take them to the
Embassy, but when they got there they could
not make the &#39;ricksha-men understand that they
were early and wanted to drive about a bit until
three. When my husband came down-stairs
they had camped outside in the snow, which
had fallen quite heavily the day before; he
heard them talking, and, of course, asked them
in at once.</p>

<p class="indent">One afternoon we entertained some American
and English women. I was quite amused
when a missionary&#39;s wife came up to me, wagging
her head and looking very solemn about
something.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you did not know,&quot; she said,
&quot;that the singer is a very naughty man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I didn&#39;t,&quot; I answered; &quot;but I don&#39;t
quite know what I can do about it&mdash;&quot; and
I&#39;m afraid I wagged my head, too, as I added,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
&quot;Don&#39;t you think we can reform him, perhaps?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She must have seen the twinkle in my eye,
for she laughed and said she didn&#39;t believe we
could. We agreed that he sang very well indeed.</p>

<p class="indent">Our last big reception was held at the Embassy
on Washington&#39;s Birthday. We had
some souvenirs made in Japanese style, little
black lacquer ash trays with the crest of the
United States in gilt upon them for the men
and fans also decorated with the crest for the
ladies. A good many of the missionaries came,
not only from Tokyo and Yokohama, but also
from the interior.</p>

<p class="indent">On St. Valentine&#39;s day I took some presents
out to Watanabe&#39;s house, where I had asked
all the children of the compound to gather.
There were about a dozen of them, sitting on
mats and making a very pretty group. They
had put a carpet over the mat, so I did not have
to take off my shoes, and a chair was procured
for me to sit in. Then I told Osame to translate
and tell them how, on St. Valentine&#39;s day,
people in America send each other verses&mdash;sometimes
love-verses, sometimes comic verses&mdash;but
that as I couldn&#39;t write any in Japanese
for them I had brought some little gifts instead.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
The children all bowed to the ground, and were
very, very respectful&mdash;much better behaved
than young people at home! They seemed to
be pleased, and after giving each one his present
I withdrew, telling Watanabe to give them
tea and cake or whatever they wanted. But
pretty soon he asked if they might come into
the Embassy and thank us. So they filed in,
bowing again, and sang a little Japanese song
to my husband and myself, which was all quite
touching. We showed them a toy tiger we had
bought in Paris that would spring and jump
when wound up, and a bear that would drink
water, both of which delighted them greatly.
After a while, bowing once again, they departed.</p>

<p class="indent">We made some very pleasant friends in
Japan. Among others we met Baroness Sonnomiya,
who is herself English but married to
a Japanese. During her husband&#39;s lifetime she
had great power, as she was the intimate friend
of the Empress Dowager. There were also
Dr. Nitobe and his wife, who were among the
most delightful people we met. I enjoyed his
books thoroughly, as well as his address before
the Japanese Peace Society, which met at the
Embassy.</p>

<p class="indent">This gathering had its amusing side, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
the president of the Society had made most of
his money selling guns! Moreover, before I
realized that it was the Peace Society which
was coming to the Embassy, I had invited the
Naval Attaché&#39;s wife and an army officer&#39;s wife
to pour tea! Just at that moment it hardly
looked as if the cause of peace was making
much headway in the world, for while we were
talking about it, terrible battles were being
fought in Turkey, the City of Mexico was under
bombardment, and there was talk of fighting
between Austria and Russia.</p>

<p class="indent">One day I called on Madame Ozaki, whom I
had met in Italy when she was Marion Crawford&#39;s
secretary. Her mother was English, her
father Japanese; she is very pretty and writes
charming stories. After living in Europe for
a number of years she returned to her father
in Japan and taught school, finally marrying
Mr. Ozaki, one of Japan&#39;s most conspicuous
politicians to-day. When I called on her I
found her dressed in European style, but she
had the true Japanese reserve; in fact was
much more Japanese than I had expected after
her many years abroad. Her house was partly
European, but when the <i>shoji</i> was thrown aside,
the little maid who received us bowed to the
ground in true native fashion.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
Madame Ozaki did not speak of politics, although
her husband had just made an attack
on Katsura, who had been for the moment
overthrown. It was said that she had received
threatening letters warning her and her husband
to flee to England.</p>

<p class="indent">At this time of political upheaval a curious
article appeared in the paper to the effect that
three men had attended their own funeral services,
which they wished to hold because they
were about to start on a dangerous expedition.
It was suggested that perhaps they might be
going to take some prominent man&#39;s life, but
nothing happened, so far as we knew, until
spring, when Mr. Abe, of the Foreign Office,
was murdered.</p>

<p class="indent">In order to explain the political situation in
Japan as we found it, I am obliged to touch
briefly on the political changes during the last
fifty years,&mdash;that is, since the time of feudalism.</p>

<p class="indent">After Commodore Perry&#39;s visit, the Tokugawa
government, whose shoguns had been the
real rulers of the country for more than two
centuries and a half, decided to open the ports
to foreigners, while officials at the Imperial
Court of the Mikado desired to continue the
policy of exclusion. Finally the reigning Shogun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
was brought to see that it would be better
for the country to have but one ruler, and resigned
in favour of the Mikado. This inaugurated
the wonderful Meiji Era&mdash;the era of
the late Emperor.</p>

<p class="indent">Since they had always been men of action,
it was the clever <i>samurai</i>, rather than the old
nobles, who found a chance to show their ability
under the new régime. They became prominent
in both the Upper and Lower Councils,
which were based somewhat on feudalism, and
yet showed strongly the influence of Western
ideas.</p>

<p class="indent">Political questions were freely discussed,
political parties appeared, and the first conventions
were held. The first cabinet was
formed in 1885, with Prince Ito as Premier.</p>

<p class="indent">The Administration was divided into ten
departments:&mdash;The Imperial Household, Foreign
Affairs, Interior, Finance, Army and
Navy, Justice, Education, Agriculture, Commerce,
and Communications. A Minister of
State was appointed head of each department.
The Empire was divided into provinces, each
ruled by a governor. In 1890 a national assembly
was granted, and the first Diet was
convened.</p>

<p class="indent">The government to-day is Conservative, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
is controlled by the <i>Genro</i>, the elder statesmen.
The Progressive party, the Seyukai, is led by
Ozaki. The Socialists make a good deal of
noise, but are still far from powerful; their
opposition to the Russian war weakened their
influence greatly. The Socialist party in Japan
was largely responsible for the recent anti-American
demonstrations.</p>

<p class="indent">For many years Prince Ito was considered
the ablest man in the country. Okubo and
Okuma were also noted leaders, while Prince
Katsura, in recent times, held great power.
Katsura was quite unpopular with the people
while we were in Japan. It was felt that he
had delayed a meeting of the Diet in order to
form a party which would be stronger and at
the same time more completely under his control.
Each time when the assembly was postponed
by a command from the Emperor, the
blame was placed on Katsura. Finally Yamamoto
was chosen to form a cabinet, which took
a long time to do on account of the different
parties. Ozaki, as head of the Progressives,
wished to dictate to Yamamoto, but the latter
would not comply, so things came to a standstill.
People seemed to think that Ozaki was
going too far, and that he had better take half
a loaf instead of insisting upon a whole one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
It appeared that the Japanese were not as yet
advanced enough for his ideas, or else that he
was too advanced for theirs. Later on, his
party yielded somewhat, and Yamamoto made
up his cabinet with Ozaki left out.</p>

<p class="indent">After the trouble had all blown over, people
said that it had all been worked out by clever
Katsura. If this is true, it was one of his last
achievements, for the Prince, who is considered
the greatest Premier Japan ever had, died in
October, 1913. His career was an interesting
one. His father belonged to the <i>samurai</i> class,
and the boy, Katsura Taro, became a staff
officer when only twenty-one. During the
Franco-Prussian war he was in Germany studying
military tactics. Later he was given charge
of the reorganizing and modernizing of the
Japanese army. The success of the Japanese
in the Chinese and Russian wars is attributed
to his genius and to his &quot;silent and unrewarded
toil.&quot; Only after the battle of the Yalu,
when he was made viscount, did his work begin
to be appreciated. Later he was created prince.
After the Chinese war he changed from soldier
to statesman&mdash;was four times Prime Minister,
and &quot;almost a whole cabinet in himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Internal politics do not run any more
smoothly in Japan than they do in our own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
country. On account of the frequent changes
of cabinet there was often rioting in front of
the Diet during the winter we were at the Embassy.
Newspaper offices were attacked and
burned, and the mob seemed to have an especial
grudge against the police, who were hardly able
to cope with the situation. Hearing that there
was rioting near the Embassy one evening
after dinner, several of us walked to a <i>matsuri</i>
not far away, but the crowd was dispersing
when we arrived, and only the policeman&#39;s
sentry-box, which was overturned, remained to
tell the tale.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Clubs are an important element in our modern
civilization, and especially for foreigners
in the Orient, where bachelors so greatly predominate&mdash;I
believe the proportion is even
more than that of forlorn damsels in Massachusetts.
At Yokohama there are two organizations,
the Yokohama United and a German
club, besides the two American societies, the
Asiatic and the Columbia.</p>

<p class="indent">The Tokyo Club has the reputation of being
the most charming in the East. It is splendidly
situated on a hill near the American Embassy.
The charges are moderate, and the service is
generally good. Japanese as well as Europeans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
belong to it. While we were in Tokyo
my husband was invited to become the foreign
vice-president, the president being an Imperial
Prince. At first he begged off, but a committee
of the club visited him and urged him
to accept the office, saying that the Japanese
were anxious to pay our country a compliment.
The Tokyo Club is more than a register of
social prominence in the city&mdash;it is also important
as a political barometer, and this polite
insistence upon L.&#39;s accepting the place was,
in its way, a tribute to America.</p>

<p class="indent">Many adventurers come to the East to seek
their fortunes, and one hears strange stories,
tragic or romantic as the case may be. A
lover waits on the dock for his fiancée on the
steamer, only to find that she has decided at
the last moment to marry another whom she
has met on the voyage; a wife returns from a
long vacation at home to find her husband consoling
himself with a <i>geisha</i>; a father who
comes out to look for his son discovers him
deep in debt and drinking himself to death.
Such are a few of the many tales we heard.</p>

<p class="indent">Some differences in social customs may be
noted here. It is polite, for instance, to remove
your shoes at the door on entering a Japanese
home. After you have entered it is only polite,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
as well as modest, to remain near the door!
When you are offered tea or anything of the
sort, it must be twice declined, but the third
time it may be accepted.</p>

<p class="indent">In conversation one must exalt the person
addressed, while everything belonging to the
speaker must be held of no value at all. A
father, on taking a bright boy to the teacher,
would naturally say, &quot;O honourable teacher,
here is my idiot son!&quot; And a mother, no matter
how deeply she may feel the death of a child,
must shed no tears but continue to smile and
say, &quot;Oh&mdash;child no good!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">What Hearn says about poetry is also true
of the Japanese smile. When in danger, smile;
when angry, smile; when sad, smile; in fact, it
is etiquette always to smile! In so many ways
the Japanese are an admirable race, and in
none more so than in this. Their instincts are
all for good taste and good manners.</p>

<p class="indent">Speaking of manners&mdash;of course, standards
vary. It used to be a common thing in the
country villages to see men and women bathing
together in large tanks, but as Westerners disapproved
of this custom, a few years ago an
order went forth that men and women bathing
together must put on suits. The result is that
to-day they sit on the edge of the tank, or on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
the seashore, and dress and undress as they
have always done, before one another, and wonder
why they are obliged to put on bathing-suits
when they go into the water! But an
order is an order, they say, and must be obeyed.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1897, when we were in Japan, foreign
clothes and top-hats were very popular, and to-day
queer combinations of clothes are still noticeable.
The foreign cap is much worn by the
men, and a sort of loose-sleeved overcoat of
English cloth, like an opera coat, is used in
winter, worn over the kimono. But the <i>tabis</i>,
or linen socks made like a mitten, and the clogs,
are worn as before, while often an unmounted
fur skin is wrapped about the neck. People
well dressed in European clothes are called
&quot;high-collared&quot;&mdash;in fact, this expression is
applied to almost anything that is Western and
modern. Many of the men who have been
abroad are very correctly and smartly clad, but
they usually put on a Japanese costume in the
evening, for they call the European dress an
&quot;uncomfortable bag.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the &quot;high-collared&quot; Japanese have
at least one meal a day in European style, and
part of the house is usually devoted to foreign
furniture. They also believe that milk and
meat should be eaten in order to make the race
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
grow larger. Most of the men are anxious to
learn Western ideas, and take great pride in
showing inventions that have been introduced.
They consider themselves quite up to date, and
so they are in many ways.</p>

<p class="indent">When my husband was first in Japan, in 1889,
a woman&#39;s highest desire was to wear European
clothes, and if she could hire a costume
and be photographed in it, she was perfectly
happy. But I do not think they feel like
that to-day. The novelty has worn off. Besides,
Japanese dressmaking is a very simple
matter; a kimono is made of straight breadths
of cloth basted together. Compared with that,
the plainest Western frock must offer many
problems.</p>

<p class="indent">It is certainly better for us not to attempt
to talk Japanese, for if one cannot speak it well
it is safer not to try at all. One is very liable
to address a nobleman in the language of a
coolie, or to mystify a servant by speaking to
him in the tongue of the higher classes&mdash;there
are three ways of making a remark, according
to the rank of the person addressed! No one
can believe the difficulties of the language till
he has tried it. To master it in any degree
requires years of study.</p>

<p class="indent">To illustrate this I will quote from Dr. Gordon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
the missionary, who gives a bit of dialogue
between teacher and pupil during a lesson.
&quot;The pupil says,&#39;The child likes <i>meshi</i>.&#39; &#39;No,&#39;
says his mentor, &#39;in speaking of a child&#39;s rice
it is better to use the word <i>mama</i>&mdash;the child
likes <i>mama</i>.&#39; Undiscouraged, the student tries
again: &#39;Do you eat <i>meshi</i>?&#39; But his teacher
stops him and tells him that it is polite, in
speaking to another of his having or eating
rice, to call it <i>gozen</i>. Having taken this in, the
student goes on with his sentence-building:
&#39;The merchant sells <i>gozen</i>.&#39; Again the teacher
calls a halt, and tells him that <i>meshi</i> and <i>gozen</i>
are used for cooked rice only, and that for
unboiled rice <i>kome</i> is the proper word. Feeling
that now he is getting into the secrets of
the language, he says, &#39;<i>Kome</i> grows in the
fields,&#39; but he is again stopped with the information
that growing rice is called <i>ine</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">More than one scholar in European tongues
has declared Japanese to be the most difficult
language in the world. One has said that a
man &quot;can learn to understand as much of
Spanish in six months as he can of Japanese
in six years.&quot; Chinese ideographs are said to
outnumber the Japanese characters to-day, and
in numerous instances have actually displaced
them, even among the common people. Many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
characters have two meanings and only in combination
can you know which is intended.
There are no pronouns in the language, nor are
there any &quot;swear-words&quot; or imperatives, the
people are so polite.</p>

<p class="indent">Family names are also very confusing&mdash;to
the Japanese themselves, I should think, as
well as to us&mdash;because of the frequency of
adoption. Each family feels that it must have
an heir to take care of the aged members while
they live and to pray for them when they die,
so a child is adopted and given the patronymic.
Blood doesn&#39;t seem to count at all, for even if
a son is born later, it is the adopted child who
inherits. Sometimes children brought up in
foreign countries take foreign names. A naval
officer told me of a charming Japanese girl
whom he knew, named Bessie. One day she
confided to him that she was going to marry
Charlie. &quot;Marry your brother!&quot; exclaimed
the astounded officer. &quot;Yes,&quot; replied Bessie
sweetly, &quot;you not know&mdash;I not father&#39;s real
child, and Charlie not father&#39;s real child. Charlie
and I, we no relation&mdash;both adopted!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Adoption is not always necessary, however,
for if a man has no children he can easily
divorce his wife, simply by telling her to return
to her father&#39;s house, and he may then marry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
another woman. The modern law also gives
this privilege of divorce to the wife, but custom
is so strong that she never leaves her husband
of her own accord.</p>

<p class="indent">Marriages are generally arranged by the
parents, with the assistance of a mutual friend.
The man and girl are allowed to see each other,
but although they are not actually forced into
marriage, few would dare to disobey their parents&#39;
wishes in the matter. They have a wedding
feast, at which the bride and groom sit
on the floor facing each other. The ceremony
sometimes consists of their both drinking from
a two-spouted tea-pot. The bride is clad in
a white kimono and veil, which she keeps all
her life, and wears once more when she is dead.
Many presents are received, but the gifts of the
groom, which are as costly as he can afford,
are offered by the bride to her parents in gratitude
for all that they have done for her in the
past.</p>

<p class="indent">After the wedding the husband takes his
bride to his home, no doubt to live with his
father and mother. The wife must not only
obey her husband, but is also much under the
rule of her mother-in-law. A man sometimes
brings his concubine into the house, and often
her children as well, and these his wife is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
obliged to adopt. If husband and wife disagree,
the go-between is usually consulted, and
occasionally succeeds in arranging matters.</p>

<p class="indent">Japanese ladies, as a rule, do not go about
very much, except those who have married foreigners
or have lived abroad. A few ladies
appear at foreign dinners with their husbands,
but very often the men have dinners at which
their wives do not appear. This may be partly
owing to their inability to speak English.</p>

<p class="indent">But, as a whole, the women have little pleasure.
When the man of the house entertains,
he either takes his guests to a tea-house or calls
in a <i>geisha</i> to help him do the honours, while
his wife sits apart in a room by herself and is
neither seen nor heard. The diversions, even
of the well-to-do, are few, comprising the arrangement
of flowers, the composition of poetry,
and an occasional visit to the theatre.</p>

<p class="indent">Women are employed in manual work, in the
fields, and in the loading of coal in the big ports,
and more and more in the new industries. The
kitchen-standard of wifehood is disappearing.
Last winter a woman made a speech in public;
this caused great excitement&mdash;in fact, it was
said that she was the first Japanese woman to
do such a thing. In spite of the many changes
which are coming about, they are as far from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
being suffragists as we were a hundred years
ago. The sex as a whole are a long way from
anything like economic freedom.</p>

<p class="indent">A woman has recently been made bank-president
in Tokyo&mdash;a quite unheard-of innovation.
She is Madame Seno, a sort of Japanese
Hetty Green. In spite of the fact that she is
over seventy, she goes to her office every morning
punctually. Her tastes are very frugal.
She wears plain cotton kimonos, and travels
third-class. At the outbreak of the Russian
war, however, she was the first to offer her
subscription to the Government.</p>

<p class="indent">The children have a very good time, spinning
tops, flying kites, and playing battledore and
shuttlecock. In the life of Japan everything
has its place and period, and the children&#39;s
games succeed one another in such due order
that it is almost impossible to buy the toys
of one month when the season has passed into
the next month. It is extraordinary how the
little people combine their work and play, for
you see a small boy carrying a baby on his back
staggering around on stilts, and another small
boy pulling a loaded cart and rolling a hoop
at the same time, and little girls with littler
girls on their backs tossing balls into the air
or bouncing them in the streets. It is really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
an unusual thing to see a woman or young girl
in the street without a baby attached to her.
I think one of the reasons why the Japanese
race has not grown larger is because the children
from a very early age carry such weights
on their backs.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Brownell tells a story of a Japanese girl
which shows the filial duty and faithfulness
that prevail. It seems she fell in love with
a foreigner, and he with her. His intentions
were good, and, although he was obliged to
go away on a trip, he wrote her that he would
soon be back to make her his wife. During
his absence, however, her parents arranged another
marriage for the girl, and on his return
he found this letter from her:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ALTHOUGH in many of her newer
phases Japan is less fascinating to
the casual tourist than where she is
still &quot;unspoiled,&quot; the efforts she is
making to get into step with the rest of the
world, and to solve the problems which are
confronting her, are full of interest to the student
and to the more sympathetic traveller.</p>

<p class="indent">To wide-awake Americans the growing Japan

much we believe in and hope for continued
peace between the two nations, there is bound

awakened and beginning to take active notice;
Japanese colonies are being planted in South
America and elsewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">While many countries of the Western world
are facing a falling birth-rate, Japan&#39;s is rising
rapidly. There is a tradition which accounts
for this state of affairs. It seems that there
was once a quarrel between the creators of the
land, Izanami threatening his wife, Izanagi,
that he would cause the population to die off
at the rate of a thousand a day. The goddess,
however, got the last word, and increased the
birth-rate to fifteen hundred a day. Apparently
she has been able to maintain the ratio
to the present time&mdash;at any rate, there is an
annual gain of half a million.</p>

<p class="indent">With a population already averaging three
hundred to every habitable square mile, it is
little wonder that the nation feels the need of
extending her boundaries and to that end is
trying to open up new territory to her emigrants.</p>

<p class="indent">Emigration began in 1885, when the King of
Hawaii called for settlers in his island realm.
Emigration societies were organized, under the
control of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and
to-day the men of Nippon greatly outnumber
the whites. The Foreign Minister still has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
entire charge of the societies: he grants all
passports, and sees to the proper distribution
of the thousands who every year leave their
own country to settle more or less permanently
in other parts of the world. Many emigrants
go to Manchuria, Korea and Formosa, some
to the Malay Peninsula and Australia, a few
to the Philippines, and an increasing number
to Central and South America. But they are
a home-loving people, and eventually three-fourths
of those who go out, return to Japan
to settle down once more with their families.</p>

<p class="indent">Greatly to Japan&#39;s mortification, her people
have been repulsed in California. Professor
Peabody of Harvard returned recently from a
trip to the Orient, and had this to say on the
subject: &quot;We accept as citizens the off-scourings
of Eastern Europe, and shut our door on
the thrifty Japanese, whose colour may be no
darker and whose descent may be from the
same original stock. What nags the Japanese
in the matter is the indirect insinuation of bad
blood, the intimation that a people whose education
is compulsory and self-help is universal
may not prove as serviceable elements in a commercial
democracy as the average of Syrians
or Copts; that, in short, the Far East is intrinsically
inferior to the Near East.&quot; He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
points out that after twenty years the Japanese
hold only about one per cent. of the agricultural
land in the State of California, and that there
are five thousand less of them there now than
there were three years ago, owing to a &quot;Gentlemen&#39;s
Agreement,&quot; by which Japan limits
her emigration to the United States.</p>

<p class="indent">This land question came up after we left
Tokyo, but it naturally interested us intensely.
The Californians seem to fear the Japanese
because they live so cheaply and work so hard
that it is thought they may come in time to
own the whole state.</p>

<p class="indent">A recent competition, with a prize offered
for the best essay on the California trouble,
showed a world-wide ignorance of the real situation
and its causes. Since this was true of
both American and Japanese competitors, it
seems to show that even the more educated
among us need to think and study more deeply
into the problem before making up our minds.</p>

<p class="indent">An extract from the <i>Japan Magazine</i>, which
is published in Tokyo, shows how men of the
better class feel regarding the land question:
&quot;Japan is not angry, but she is earnestly anxious
to know whether America will rest content
to allow the California attitude to pass as
national. No, Japan is not wrathful, but she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
is mortified to see any section of the country
that calls itself her friend, somewhat abruptly
suggest that her absence is preferred to her
presence.... Happily, the California attitude
does not represent the American people, so that
Japan still has hopes of a reconsideration and
a reinstatement. On the other hand, it is unfortunate
that the majority of Japanese residents
in the United States are not really representative
of Japan. Certainly the average of
emigrants going to America is not at all on an
intellectual or social equality with the average
citizen at home ... they are the poorest and
most unfortunate of their countrymen, and
would never have left home if they could have
succeeded as well in their own country. The
same may be said of every immigrant from
Europe.... When the lowest class can do so
well, a better class would do even better....
The main hope lies at present in so instructing
intending emigrants that they will be able to
assimilate speedily and amicably with American
society and abide by the customs and laws
of the country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It is interesting to note that in Japan they
talk of the &quot;white peril&quot; and tell of the cruelty
and oppression of Europeans to their &quot;less
civilized&quot; yellow brethren. They have no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
difficulty in finding cases where might has made
right, even in very recent times.</p>

<p class="indent">It is suggested by a Japanese newspaper that
their diplomatists, in dealing with our country,
have been imitating the attitude of the British
toward the United States, apparently believing
it to be in the end the one most likely to achieve
results. The main features of this &quot;attitude&quot;
are much patience and brotherly kindness, but
unwavering firmness.</p>

<p class="indent">Before leaving the subject a few statistics
are not out of place. The reason why the question
centres about California is that sixty per
cent. of all the Japanese in the country are in
that state, where most of them are engaged in
agriculture. During the last five years the
number of immigrants has steadily decreased.
In 1911, the Japanese farmers produced more
than twelve million dollars&#39; worth of crops,
which is nearly twenty per cent. of the entire
yield of the state. Reckoning their labour on
land they do not control, however, they are
responsible for at least ninety per cent. of the
agricultural products of California, whether
vineyard, vegetable, or fruit. The most successful
farmers are in the northern part of the
state, where the low district along the river is
tabooed by Americans, and but for the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
from Japan would be idle and useless. The
immense harvest of fruit and grain in the San
Joaquin valley could hardly be gathered without
them.</p>

<p class="indent">During the agitation against Asiatics, when
the number of Japanese was reduced, and Indians,
Greeks, Mexicans, and Italians took their
places, the American managers admitted that
one Japanese was equal to three or four of the
other nationalities in agricultural work. The
farmer from Nippon is a hard-working man,
always eager to have his own little hut and a
wife and family.</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Sidney L. Gulick, in his recent book,
&quot;The American Japanese Problem,&quot; points
out the one-sidedness of the attacks made upon
the Japanese in California. He says, for instance,
that &quot;When Governor Johnson and
Secretary Bryan came to Florin [a town used
as an &#39;awful example&#39; of Japanese occupation],
Mr. Reese, already known for his anti-Japanese
attitude, was chosen by Governor
Johnson to be their guide and instructor, while
Mr. Landsborough, known to Governor Johnson
as pro-Japanese, was turned aside.&quot; The
report of the State Labour Commission, which
investigated the situation, was so favourable to
the Japanese that the state government is said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
to have suppressed it&mdash;at any rate, it has
never been published.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> says: &quot;The Japanese
have become an important factor in the
agricultural and commercial life of the southwest.
Their thrift is remarkable, their patience
inexhaustible, and they are natural gardeners,
seeming to read the secrets of the very soil
and to know instinctively what will do well and
what will do better. The result of this close
study of soil conditions, close observation of
crop and weather conditions, enables the Japanese
to control to a great degree the vegetable-raising
industry of Southern California.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Considering that there are more Italians in
New York than there are in Rome, and that one
person in every three in our metropolis is a
Jew, while half the population of Norway is in
this country&mdash;to mention a few cases&mdash;it
doesn&#39;t seem as if we ought to object seriously
to a handful of Japanese immigrants.</p>

<p class="indent">Although California repulsed them, South
America has proved very hospitable to the
Japanese. The &quot;Latin-American A-B-C&quot; of
Argentina, Brazil and Chile, receives their
colonists eagerly. Guglielmo Ferrero, the Italian
philosopher, finds traces of a possible racial
likeness between the Japanese and the natives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
of South America. While he is by no means
sure of this relationship himself, he says,
&quot;Japan will not shrink from relying upon
the anthropologic theories above stated for the
purpose of opening to its emigrants the ports
of this immense and wealthy continent and
establishing the strongest ties of close friendship
where Europeans are gathering such harvests
of wealth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The friendship which exists between Japan
and Argentina, however, is not based upon any
real or fancied racial ties. It began at the time
when the latter country sold the Island nation
two new warships which she was having built
in Europe, thus proving herself a friend in
need. Emigration to Argentina has only just
begun, but the future is very promising commercially,
not alone on account of the cordial
relations, but because the republic offers a good
market for Japanese merchandise&mdash;with a
population of but six million, she buys and sells
more in a year than China with her three hundred
million.</p>

<p class="indent">There is a great demand for Japanese immigrants
in Brazil, where there is no race prejudice
to be encountered and much fertile land to
be had for the asking. Brazil is a Portuguese
country, which is especially appropriate, since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
Portugal was the first to send missionaries to
Japan, nearly three centuries ago.</p>

<p class="indent">A company has been formed in Japan for
the purpose of colonizing in Brazil, aiming to
settle the surplus population in a country where
it will be well treated. At least three thousand
immigrants a year are promised by the company,
but more will be welcomed, Brazil promising
land, roads, and transportation from
Japan. Farmers, who in their own country
received perhaps fifteen cents a day, are able
to save from one hundred to three hundred dollars
a year to send home, while wages are steadily
rising.</p>

<p class="indent">A writer in a recent issue of a Brazilian
bulletin comments on the scene at the dock when
the first shipload of Japanese immigrants arrived.
&quot;The spectacle was curious and very
different to the disembarking of European immigrants,&quot;
he says. &quot;The men, many of whom
had their chests adorned with the Manchurian
medal, carried little flags in which the Brazilian
and Japanese colours were mingled, green and
gold, white and red. The extreme cleanliness
of the Japanese was remarkable; while European
emigrants, and particularly those from
the south of Europe, leave the ship that has
transported them in a filthy state, the cabins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
of the boat on which the Japanese travelled
were on arrival as neat as at the time of departure.
Each of them had in his baggage ...
numerous articles of toilet, tooth-paste, and
tooth-brushes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As yet there is little commerce between
Brazil and Japan, but another year will probably
see a change in this respect, for the opening
of the Canal will make the route four thousand
miles shorter, and the freightage, as a
consequence, much lower.</p>

<p class="indent">The Panama Canal will make a considerable
difference in Japanese trade with the United
States. At present her exports to our country
are nearly double her imports from us. There
are now two routes to New York&mdash;the quicker
one, to San Francisco and thence by rail, the
slower one, all the way by sea, through the Suez
Canal; the former is expensive, while the latter
may require six months. It will be possible
to make the trip by way of Panama in almost
the time needed for the shorter route, but with
the low freightage charge of the longer.</p>

<p class="indent">The Canal will also facilitate trade with the
eastern coast of South America, giving direct
intercourse, not only with Brazil, but also with
Argentina. At present exports to these countries
are sent via Europe and transshipped.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
On account of her insular position Japan has
always been a sea-going nation, but her shipping
has increased enormously since the war
with Russia. She now has over six thousand
ships, manned for the most part by her own
seamen. The question of building larger liners,
such as are being put into commission for the
Atlantic trade, has been discussed. At present
the Japanese steamers which carry passengers
are as good as the American ones, if not better.
Instead of buying them abroad, Japan is beginning
to build her own steamships&mdash;there are
large shipyards at Nagasaki and Kobe.</p>

<p class="indent">In her efforts to cope with her rapidly
growing population and multiplying industries,
Japan is seeking trade-openings all over the
world. Her business men are touring the globe
in search of them. At present she is, perhaps,
most interested in China, which has doubled the
amount of her annual trade in the last ten
years. The first months of 1913 showed a gain
of forty-six per cent. over the corresponding
months of 1912 in exports to China, while the
United States exceeded her previous purchases
by only three per cent. Of the hundred thousand
Japanese in the former country, nearly
all are engaged in commercial pursuits, rather
than in farming as they are in other parts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
of the world. Japan also has the advantage
of being near this great market, and with labour
so cheap she can easily compete with England,
Germany, and the United States. She could
make great profits if it were not necessary for
her to buy most of her manufacturing machinery
abroad.</p>

<p class="indent">America is by far Japan&#39;s best customer.
She sold us and our colonies over a hundred
million dollars&#39; worth of goods last year&mdash;about
a third of her total exports. Incidentally,
she is an excellent customer of ours, for
she bought over thirty million dollars&#39; worth
of cotton alone, in 1912, and much else besides.</p>

<p class="indent">Usually the Empire finds it necessary to import
the raw materials and the machinery for
their manufacture, while she exports the finished
product. Much of her Oriental trade consists
in yarn and cloth; the raw material is
brought in from China and America and sold
again to China and India.</p>

<p class="indent">In no way is the growth of Japan more
striking than in her industries. Sixty years
ago she had no foreign trade, for she had nothing
to export. To-day Great Britain finds her
an interesting rival. Mills and factories have
sprung up like mushrooms, almost over night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
The conditions which accompanied this change
and rapid development are worth noting.</p>

<p class="indent">In feudal times both the arts and the industries
were carried on under the patronage of
the nobility&mdash;the <i>daimyo</i> and the <i>samurai</i>.
They were great lovers of beauty, these warlike
lords; it is said that many a <i>samurai</i>, returning
from the wars covered with glory, preferred
the gift of an exquisite vase as a reward for
his valour, rather than lands or decorations.
They encouraged their subjects to make things;
but, more than that, to make them beautiful.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, manufacturing conditions were
very primitive. There was no division of labour,
so that often a man would need to be
skilled in several crafts in order to make a
single article. Each man worked by himself.
A boy inherited his father&#39;s trade, whether he
liked it or not. Each trade had its guild, to
which a worker must belong if he wished to
be free to carry on his business. These guilds
still exist to-day, but have far less power than
labour unions in America or guilds in China.</p>

<p class="indent">The feudal system came to an end in 1868, and
private ownership of property began. Organized
industries appeared on a small scale: machinery
was imported from Europe and America,
railroads were built and factories started.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
Nine years later the first industrial exposition
ever seen in Japan was held in Tokyo; soon
afterward the Island Empire was sending exhibits
to Europe and America to show the world
what she could do. This, of course, resulted in
stimulating the export trade and the manufacturing
of such articles as were most in demand.</p>

<p class="indent">After the Chinese war, in 1895, there was a
great boom. Old methods of private enterprise
were no longer adequate to meet the increased
demand. Stock companies began to be organized.
The Government itself took over certain
forms of industry for the purpose of raising
revenues. Improved machinery was introduced
from the Western world, and experts were engaged.</p>

<p class="indent">Since the Russo-Japanese war industries
have multiplied so tremendously that the demand
for labour has been very great. Wages
have gone up, and the workers have become
much more independent. As yet, there have
been no labour strikes of any importance; fortunately,
no Gompers or McNamaras have appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time in Japan women began to
be employed. They are to be found in large
numbers in the factories near Osaka (which is
called the Chicago of Japan) and Kobe, as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
as in the districts near Tokyo. Most of these
women are peasants from the provincial sections
who serve on three-year contracts. Children
are still employed, although the Government
does not allow them to go to work under
twelve years of age.</p>

<p class="indent">Wages in all branches of industry are still
very low, and the cost of living is rising. But
living conditions, even at their worst, are much
better than with us among corresponding
classes. Weavers, dyers, and spinners receive
from ten to twenty cents a day, while a streetcar
conductor gets five or six dollars a month.</p>

<p class="indent">The factory owners keep their employees in
compounds, where they provide some sort of
shelter free and charge a nominal amount for
meals. In the older type of factory there is
often crowding and a low standard of living,
but in the more modern and socialistic ones
great attention is paid to the worker&#39;s needs,
physical, mental and moral.</p>

<p class="indent">There is a fine factory in Hyogo from which
many of our mills might well take pattern. Besides
having beautiful recreation and dormitory
gardens, there are rows of pretty, two-storied
houses with tiny gardens in front of
each. The owners also furnish a theatre for
the use of their employees, a coöperative shop,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
a spacious hospital, and schools and kindergartens
for the children.</p>

<p class="indent">Japan has more than seventy cotton mills
in operation, and can manufacture cloth as
cheaply as any of its rivals. The home demand
is large, since the lower classes wear only cotton
the year round. Cotton towels, printed in
blue and white, have become so popular in
America during the last year or two that the
export trade in them has increased enormously.</p>

<p class="indent">Four years ago a boy of eighteen, Torakichi
Inouye, succeeded to the hereditary management
of a large towel firm in Tokyo. He realized
that foreigners seemed much attracted by
the pretty designs, and were buying them in
surprising quantities at the shops where they
were for sale. So he began trying them on the
American markets, with the success that we
have seen. To-day his factory is making two
hundred thousand towels a day, and in ten
months shipped over 175,000,000 pieces. He
originated the idea of printing designs that
could be combined into table-covers, bedspreads,
etc. The patterns for the towels are
cut in paper, like a stencil, and are folded in
between many alternate layers of the cloth.
The indigo-blue dye is then forced through by
means of an air-pump.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
Instead of importing all their machinery, as
formerly, the Japanese are now beginning to
manufacture it for themselves. They get the
foreigners to come and teach them how to build
steamships and locomotives, and as soon as
they have learned whatever they wish to know
they put their own countrymen in charge of
the work. Although at one time there were
many foreign engineers in different parts of
the Empire, every year finds fewer of them
filling important positions. This is true in
every branch of industry.</p>

<p class="indent">Inventive genius is being cultivated, too, for
clever people are not content simply to imitate.
A system of wireless quite different from that
generally in use is said to have been perfected
for the navy. Wireless telephones are used
over short distances, and are being rapidly
improved and extended. Quite an advance has
been made this last year in aviation also. Experts
in both army and navy are making good
records.</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of many difficulties several thousand
miles of railway have been built during the last
forty years. Engineers often find it necessary
not only to tunnel through mountains, but under
rivers the beds of which are shifting. To make
matters even more interesting, there are typhoons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
earthquakes, and torrents of rain which
end in floods. Notwithstanding the cost of
building and maintaining the roads under such
conditions, railway travel is cheaper than with
us or in Europe. First class costs less than
third in an English train.</p>

<p class="indent">For the wherewithal to feed her people,
Japan depends largely upon her native farmers.
In spite of their poverty these are of a higher
class socially than in most Western countries.
The <i>samurai</i> and <i>daimyo</i> made much of agriculture,
ranking it above trade. The Government
to-day continues to do all that it can to
aid and encourage farming. Experiment stations
have been established, and various coöperative
societies formed for the use of the
farmers, who also have a special bank of their
own. Prices are rising, and, on the whole, the
prospects are good, although the nature of the
land is against any great advance. The surface
of the country is so mountainous that only
about one-seventh can be cultivated, and that
is not especially fertile. Sixty per cent. of the
population is agricultural.</p>

<p class="indent">Each man owns his own little farm, which he
tills in primitive fashion, growing rice, wheat,
or beans, according to the soil or season. Almost
no livestock is kept, and pastures are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
rarely seen. An average farm, supporting a
family of six, has about three and a half
acres.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">
<a name="illo_187" id="illo_187"></a><img class="border" src="images/illo_187.jpg" width="700" height="452" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">A RICE FIELD.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The soya bean, which is much grown, really
furnishes an industry in itself. It has many
uses. <i>Soy</i>, the national sauce, is made from it,
and also bean cheese. Recently an English
chemist has discovered a method of producing
artificial milk from it. Its oil is extracted and
sold to foreign markets, rivalling the cottonseed
oil, which is better known. The pulp remaining
is used as fodder and fertilizer.</p>

<p class="indent">Rice is the favourite crop and is of such good
quality that much of it is exported to India,
whence a cheaper grade is imported in return
for the use of the poorer classes. Instead of
forming the national diet, as we are inclined
to suppose, rice is really such a luxury that
many people never eat it except in sickness or
on feast-days.</p>

<p class="indent">For all the Japanese farmer is so independent,
he is often miserably poor. An acre of
rice may in good years produce an annual profit
of a dollar and a half, but there is quite likely
to be a deficit instead. When one considers that
it takes the labour of seventeen men and nine
women to cultivate two and a half acres of
rice, this is not surprising. Vegetables do better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
than grain, and mulberry plantations for
the raising of silkworms do best of all, but it
has been figured that a hard-working man, with
very likely a large family to support, does well
if he clears a hundred and twenty dollars in the
course of a year. As a result of this, most of
the peasantry are in debt, and many of them
are leaving their farms and going to the city,
as they are doing in our own country.</p>

<p class="indent">Really more important than rice, of which we
hear so much, is the sweet potato, of which we
hear so little. The first one reached Japan
some two hundred years ago as the gift of the
King of the Loochoo Islands to the Lord of
Satsuma. The latter prince was so pleased
with the taste of it that he asked for seed-potatoes,
and before long the Government commanded
that the new vegetable should be grown
throughout the country, since it could be raised
even in famine years, when other crops failed.
In Tokyo there are over a thousand sweet-potato
shops, where one buys them halved or
sliced or whole, all hot and nicely roasted, serving
in cold weather to warm one&#39;s hands before
delighting the inner man&mdash;or rather, child&mdash;for
they are a delicacy much prized by children.
There is no waste in their preparation, for not
only are the peelings sold for horse-fodder, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
the ashes in which they are roasted are used
again around the charcoal in the <i>hibachi</i>!</p>

<p class="indent">The silkworm was introduced into Japan by
a Chinese prince in 195 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>, and a century later
Chinese immigrants taught the people how to
weave the new thread. To-day sericulture is
largely carried on by the women and children
of the farm, and is twice as productive as the
rest of the crops. As in poultry-raising, however,
the gains are not in proportion to the
size of the plant, the smaller ones being the
more successful.</p>

<p class="indent">The mining industries have been much slower
to develop than most of the others, although
they are of ancient origin. A great deal of
metal&mdash;gold, silver and copper&mdash;was exported
during the Middle Ages. It has been
suggested that Columbus had the gold of Japan
in view when he set out upon the voyage which
resulted in the discovery of America.</p>

<p class="indent">Japan has been described as the missionary
to the Far East. Certainly, whatever her motives,
her influence in Korea and Formosa has
been most helpful. The latter island has been
nearly freed from smallpox and other plagues,
while its revenues have been increased six
hundred per cent. Her influence in the liberalizing
of China is marked, too, although it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
less concentrated, of course, than in the smaller
fields.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese have an undoubted advantage
over other nationalities in China. Their agents
know the language, but more than that, they
are able to adapt themselves to native conditions
of living and to &quot;think Chinese.&quot; For
ages past China has been the godmother of
Japan, teaching her many valuable lessons in
art and industry. It is now only fair that the
pupil should do what she can to help her ancient
teacher. Naturally the form which this expression
of gratitude takes is by no means
unprofitable commercially to the younger nation!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With regard to that part of Manchuria
which comes under Japanese influence,&quot; writes
a British merchant, &quot;the conveniences and facilities
afforded by the Japanese to one and all
in regard to banking institutions, railway communications,
postal and telegraph service are
far and away superior to those afforded by the
Russian and Chinese institutions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It has taken Europe six hundred years to do
what Japan has done in sixty, and if the little
Island Nation has left a few things undone, or
has made mistakes and perhaps gone too far
in some directions, it is not surprising. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
marvel is that with the thrill and bustle of
modern business life she has kept so much of
the ancient charm and delight as to make us
even to-day feel the witchery of her Spell.</p>

<h2><a name="chVII" id="chVII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="h3">A YEAR OF FESTIVALS</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illo_194.jpg" width="100" height="101" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MOST important and most generally
observed of all Japanese festivals is
the New Year, the holiday season
lasting for about two weeks. The
most striking feature to us was the varied decorations
of the gates, which were adorned with
a collection of emblems of one kind and another,
producing an effect unique in the extreme, even
if their significance was unknown. These decorations
are put up before Christmas in the
case of the foreigners, but those in front of the
native houses are not completed until New
Year, and remain in place throughout the holidays.</p>

<p class="indent">A large number of apparently incongruous
articles are used in ornamenting Japanese
homes for the New Year, and not until we learn
the symbolic meaning of each one of these can
we understand their use. They range from
bamboo, ferns, oranges, pine-trees and branches
of <i>yusuri</i>-tree to paper bags, straw ropes, bits
of charcoal, seaweed and even lobsters, incomprehensible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
as it may seem to the Western mind
that some of these objects should have any significance
whatever.</p>

<p class="indent">As you enter a house you discover, stretched
from post to post of the gateway above your
head, a thick, twisted rope&mdash;the <i>nawa</i>&mdash;with
the following emblems suspended from it: first,
the <i>yebi</i>&mdash;lobster&mdash;whose bent back is the
symbol of long life, suggesting the hope that he
who passes beneath may not die until time has
bowed his back in like manner. Surrounding
the lobster, as a frame to its brilliant scarlet,
are the <i>yusuri</i> branches, on which the young
leaves are budding while the old have not as
yet fallen, significant of the several generations
of the family within. Almost hidden by the
lobster and directly in the centre of the <i>nawa</i>,
are perhaps the prettiest of all the emblems,
two dainty fern-fronds, symbolical of the happiness
and unity of wedded life, and carefully
placed between the two, a budding leaflet emblematic
of fruitfulness.</p>

<p class="indent">From Japanese mythology we learn the significance
of the <i>nawa</i>&mdash;the rope of rice straw.
Ama-terasu, the Sun-Goddess, in terror of her
brother, Susa-no-o, fled to a cave, from which
she refused to come forth. Then the Eighty
Myriads of Gods took counsel as to how they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
might induce her to bestow upon them the light
of her face once more. They decided to give
a wonderful entertainment, introduced by the
songs of thousands of birds. Ama-terasu came
out, curious to know the meaning of these
sounds, daylight returned, and the gods
stretched a barrier across the mouth of the
cavern in order that she might never retreat
to it again. The <i>nawa</i> represents this obstacle,
and wherever it hangs, the sweetness of spring
is supposed to enter.</p>

<p class="indent">But one may ask, what is the connection between
the New Year and the coming of spring?
According to the old Japanese calendar, the
year began at any time between January sixteenth
and February nineteenth, so it came, as
a rule, at least a month later than with us, and
the idea of spring was always associated with
the New Year. Although spring arrives in
Tokyo about the time it does in Washington,
January first is far enough from any suggestion
of buds and flowers: but the Japanese
keep the old associations and call the first fortnight
of the year &quot;spring-advent&quot; and the
second fortnight &quot;the rains.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mention of spring suggests a charming
stanza by an anonymous Japanese poet, which
I give in Professor Chamberlain&#39;s translation:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Spring, spring has come, while yet the landscape bears</span><br />
<span class="i0">Its fleecy burden of unmelted snow!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now may the zephyr gently &#39;gin to blow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To melt the nightingale&#39;s sweet frozen tears.&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">That the gods may not be forgotten, propitiatory
offerings in the shape of twisted pieces
of paper cut diagonally&mdash;<i>gohei</i>, meaning purification&mdash;are
attached at intervals along the
<i>nawa</i>, looking for all the world like the horns
stuck in the hair in the children&#39;s game of
&quot;Horned Lady.&quot; Setting off the scarlet hue
of the lobster, on either side is placed a <i>daidai</i>,&mdash;a
kind of orange&mdash;expressing the hope that
the family pedigree may flourish. The rather
incongruous piece of charcoal&mdash;<i>sumi</i>, meaning
homestead&mdash;comes next, and gently waving to
and fro beneath the oranges may be seen strips
of seaweed&mdash;<i>konbu</i>&mdash;signifying rejoicing.</p>

<p class="indent">On either side of the gateway stands the
guardian pine-tree, indicative of long life, supporting
the <i>nawa</i>, which is about six feet in
length&mdash;on the right the <i>me-matsu</i> (the red
pine), and on the left the <i>O-matsu</i> (the honourable
black pine). Behind, giving grace and
dainty freshness to the whole, nod and sway
the exquisite feathery branches of the bamboo,
typical of health and strength. The full list
of symbols is not always seen, as the task and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
the purse of the individual are both consulted
before deciding upon his gateway decorations.
But even among the poorest there is never a
doorway wholly unadorned; the omission would
be sure to bring harm to the householder and
misfortune to his friends, and the gods unpropitiated
would look frowningly down during the
year. Although two diminutive pine-trees before
a house may be all that can be afforded, the
dweller within feels as securely guarded against
harm in the coming year as if the whole panoply
of emblems were waving over his humble doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">The pine-trees remind me of Bashô&#39;s epigram
on New Year decorations, beautifully translated
by E. W. Clement:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;At every door</span><br />
<span class="i4">The pine-trees stand:</span><br />
<span class="i4">One mile-post more</span><br />
<span class="i4">To the spirit-land;</span><br />
<span class="i4">And as there&#39;s gladness,</span><br />
<span class="i4">So there&#39;s sadness.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Much brighter colours are worn at the New
Year than at other times, and presents are
exchanged. The older people make gifts of
dwarf trees, while the children give one another
dolls and kites, and games of battledore and
shuttlecock, which one sees both old and young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
playing in the streets. The small, stocky horses
that drag the carts with their picturesque loads
are adorned with streamers of mauve and lemon
and rose in honour of the first drive of the
year, and many of the carts carry flags and
lanterns on bamboo poles, so that the streets
are very gay. Tokyo is especially gay the last
evening of the old year, because a <i>matsuri</i>, or
fair, is held in the principal street, with little
booths illuminated by lanterns, where any one
who is in debt can sell his belongings in order
to pay all he owes and begin the New Year
fairly.</p>

<p class="indent">Small groups go from house to house, carrying
the strange lion-dog&#39;s head, which they put
through various antics, while they dance and
sing in order to drive away evil spirits. (The
lion-dog is a mythical animal borrowed from
the Chinese.) They are usually rewarded by
the owner with a few pennies. People go about
on New Year&#39;s Day, stopping at the doorways
of their friends to say: &quot;May you be as old
as the pine and as strong as the bamboo, may
the stork make nests in your chimney and the
turtle crawl over your floor.&quot; The turtle and
the stork symbolize long life.</p>

<p class="indent">Part of the preparation for the New Year
festival consists in the annual house-cleaning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
This custom is kept up to-day, and is carried
out even in foreign houses. Under the old
régime, we are told, officials of the Shogun&#39;s
Court sent overseers carrying dusters on long
poles to superintend the work and thrust their
brooms into cracks and corners where dust
might be left undisturbed by careless servants,
at the same time making mystic passes with
their poles to form the Chinese character for
water. The merchants, too, have their &quot;big
cleaning,&quot; when all their wares are tossed out
into the street. As one of the Japanese poets
has said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;Lo, house-cleaning is here;</span><br />
<span class="i4">Gods of Buddha and Shinto</span><br />
<span class="i4">Are jumbled together</span><br />
<span class="i4">All on the grass!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">One of the most attractive customs associated
with the New Year is that of placing under the
little wooden pillows of the children a picture
of the <i>Takara-bune</i>, the Treasure Ship, with the
Seven Gods of Good Fortune on board. This
ship is said to come into port on New Year&#39;s
Eve and to bring a wonderful cargo, among
other rare things being the Lucky Rain-Coat,
the Inexhaustible Purse, the Sacred Key and
the Hat of Invisibility. This is the Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
interpretation of our expression, &quot;When my
ship comes in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the Embassy the observance of New
Year&#39;s Eve was a mixture of American and
Japanese customs. We invited all the unmarried
members of the Staff, and after visiting
the <i>matsuri</i> we returned to the Embassy, and
as the clock struck twelve we passed a loving
bowl, and all joined hands and sang songs.
Then, as the passing year was the year of the
cock, and 1913 was the year of the bullock, some
one crowed a good-bye to the rooster of 1912,
and some one else mooed like a bullock as a
welcome to the newcomer, and we had a very
jolly time.</p>

<p class="indent">But New Year&#39;s Day itself is not without its
religious and ceremonial observances. Every
man is obliged to rise at the hour of the tiger&mdash;the
early hour of four o&#39;clock&mdash;and put on
new clothes. Then he worships the gods, does
homage to the spirits of his ancestors, and
offers congratulations to his parents and the
older members of the family. All this must be
done before he can breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">The first repast of the year is in every sense
symbolic. The tea is made with water drawn
from the well as the first ray of the sun touches
it. The principal dish is a compound of six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
ingredients, which are always the same, although
the proportions may be varied. A special
kind of <i>saké</i> is drunk from a red lacquer
cup in order to ensure good health for the coming
year. In addition to these things, there is
always an &quot;elysian stand&quot;&mdash;a red lacquer
tray, covered with evergreen <i>yusuri</i> leaves and
bearing a lobster, a rice dumpling, dried sardines,
and herring roe, also oranges, persimmons
and chestnuts, much as in a &quot;lucky bag.&quot;
All these articles of food are in some way emblematic
of long life and happiness, and the
stand itself represents the chief of the three
islands of Chinese mythology, where all the
birds and animals are white, where mountains
and palaces are of gold, and where youth is
eternal.</p>

<p class="indent">New Year calls are as much a part of the
celebration in Japan as in the Western world.
Originally, these were genuine visits, and the
&quot;elysian stand&quot; was set before the guests for
their refreshment, but among the higher classes
the calls are now the most conventional of
affairs, in which the visitor simply writes his
name in a book or leaves a card in a basket,
often without being received by the householder
at all. The caller leaves also a little gift of
some sort&mdash;such as a basket of oranges, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
bunch of dried seaweed, or a box of sweetmeats&mdash;wrapped
in a neat package and tied with a
red and gold cord in a butterfly knot. A finishing
touch is given to the parcel by a sprig
of green in a quiver-shaped envelope tucked
under the knot.</p>

<p class="indent">The seventh of January was the proper time
to go out into the fields and gather seven common
plants, among which were dandelion, chickweed
and shepherd&#39;s purse. These were boiled
with rice and eaten for health, strength and
good luck.</p>

<p class="indent">Originally, the Japanese had no weekly day
of rest and recreation, but in recent years the
Sabbath has been made an official rest-day, to
be observed by all in government employ. The
mass of the people, however, bring up their
average of holidays by other occasions. There
are during the year ten or twelve special feasts
which are always observed&mdash;the Emperor&#39;s
birthday, or when he eats first of the season&#39;s
rice crop, or makes a pilgrimage to the shrines
of his mythological ancestors, and other similar
events, are all made the occasion of a national
holiday and popular rejoicing. Besides,
every section of a city or district in the country
has a little <i>matsuri</i> every day or two, and these,
of course, are held holiday, but it must be remembered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
that many of the festivals mentioned
in this chapter belonged to Old Japan, and are
dying out to-day.</p>

<p class="indent">Some festivals take the names of animals,
such as the Horse Day, and the years are also
named after animals, 1914 being the year of the
tiger. The Fox Temple Festival is well known,
when the people pray for good crops. Among
other holidays are the Lucky Day, the seventh
day of the seventh month, when two planets
are in conjunction, and the first day of the
eighth month. Certain prescribed flowers and
plants are used on each of these occasions.
Any important date, such as that on which a
young man comes of age, or an official is promoted
in rank, is also made a festal day.</p>

<p class="indent">The twenty-eighth day of every month is
observed by the Japanese, but more generally
in the first month than in any other, in order
to begin the New Year properly. We went to
a Buddhist temple in Uyeno Park, where they
beg the god of luck to protect them and keep
them from misfortune throughout the year.
Before entering the temple, as is always done,
they purify themselves by washing their hands
and scattering little offerings of money done
up in paper. On account of some ancient custom,
money is much more valued in Japan if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
wrapped in paper. Candles are lighted, and
priests sitting cross-legged with their backs
to the audience read from sacred books. A
holy fire is kindled, and each worshipper buys
a hundred tapers and walks from the fire to
the shrine, praying, I suppose, for they seem
to be saying something. As they reach the fire
again, they throw a taper into it, and repeat
the ceremony till all are gone. Surrounding the
temple are little booths, where toys are for sale
and gay lanterns and good things to eat and
drink are displayed, so that when the prayers
have been offered, the people can enjoy themselves
in feasting, watching the jugglers at
their tricks, or making small purchases at the
booths.</p>

<p class="indent">On the night of February third, distant
shouts were heard at the Embassy. Upon inquiring
what the noise was about, I was told
that this was called &quot;Bean Night,&quot; when the
servants in most houses throw beans out into
the garden, crying, &quot;Demons go out, luck come
in.&quot; As I passed a temple that evening, I saw
crowds of people, and noticed some Shinto or
Buddhist priests doing a religious dance.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">DISPLAY OF DOLLS, DOLLS&#39; FESTIVAL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The third of March is the Dolls&#39; Festival, the
great day of the year for little girls. At all
times of the year the Japanese have miniature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
belongings for children which are very attractive,
but just before this festival the shops are
even prettier than at Christmas in America,
and the windows are always arranged either to
show the <i>No</i> dance&mdash;two figures in curious
dress in front of a gold screen with pine-tree
decorations&mdash;or the Emperor and Empress.
These dolls are placed on the top shelf with
a screen behind and a canopy overhead to suggest
a palace. Although for twenty years or
more the Emperor has generally appeared in
uniform on State occasions, and the Empress
has been gowned in the latest Parisian style,
these Imperial dolls wear flowing robes and
have strange crowns upon their heads, the Emperor,
too, having his hair curiously arranged;
and they sit in Japanese fashion on a raised
platform. On the shelf below are ladies-in-waiting,
then follow musicians, lanterns and
articles of food down the steps in order, all
very tiny and perfectly made.</p>

<p class="indent">For a picture of this festival as it is kept
even to-day I borrow from Miss Alice M.
Bacon&#39;s &quot;Japanese Girls and Women,&quot; only
adding that I was so delighted with the toys
myself that I bought many of them, and with
the aid of Watanabe set them up in proper
order at the Embassy:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
&quot;It was my privilege,&quot; says Miss Bacon,
&quot;to be present at the Feast of Dolls in the
house of one of the Tokugawa <i>daimyos</i>, a house
in which the old forms and ceremonies were
strictly observed, and over which the wave of
foreign innovation had passed so slightly that
even the calendar still remained unchanged, and
the feast took place upon the third day of the
third month of the old Japanese year, instead
of on the third day of March, which is the usual
time for it now. At this house, where the dolls
had been accumulating for hundreds of years,
five or six broad, red-covered shelves, perhaps
twenty feet long or more, were completely filled
with them and with their belongings. The Emperor
and Empress appeared again and again,
as well as the five Court musicians, and the
tiny furnishings and utensils were wonderfully
costly and beautiful. Before each Emperor and
Empress was set an elegant lacquered table
service&mdash;tray, bowls, cups, <i>saké</i> pots, rice baskets,
etc., all complete&mdash;and in each utensil
was placed the appropriate variety of food.
The <i>saké</i> used on this occasion is a sweet, white
liquor, brewed especially for this feast, as different
from the ordinary <i>saké</i> as sweet cider is
from the hard cider upon which a man may
drink himself into a state of intoxication. Besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
the table service, everything that an Imperial
doll can be expected to need or desire
is placed upon the shelves. Lacquered <i>norimono</i>,
or palanquins; lacquered bullock carts,
drawn by bow-legged black bulls&mdash;these were
the conveyances of the great in Old Japan, and
these, in minute reproductions, are placed upon
the red-covered shelves. Tiny silver and brass
<i>hibachi</i>, or fire-boxes, are there, with their
accompanying tongs and charcoal baskets&mdash;whole
kitchens, with everything required for
cooking the finest of Japanese feasts, as finely
made as if for actual use; all the necessary
toilet apparatus&mdash;combs, mirrors, utensils for
blackening the teeth, for shaving the eyebrows,
for reddening the lips and whitening the face&mdash;all
these things are there to delight the souls
of all the little girls who may have the opportunity
to behold them. For three days the Imperial
effigies are served sumptuously at each
meal, and the little girls of the family take
pleasure in serving the Imperial Majesties;
but when the feast ends, the dolls and their
belongings are packed away in their boxes, and
lodged in the fireproof warehouse for another
year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As we may well believe from the tenderness
with which it is treated, the Japanese doll is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
not simply a plaything but a means of teaching
a girl to be a good wife and mother. It is never
abused, but is so well cared for that it may be
in use for a hundred years. Certain large dolls,
representing children two or three years old,
were formerly believed to contain human souls,
and it was thought that if they were not well
treated they would bring ill luck upon their
owners.</p>

<p class="indent">A story is told of a maid who was much disturbed
by dreams of a one-armed figure&mdash;the
ghost of a girl or woman&mdash;which haunted her
bed at night. These visitations were repeated
so many times that she decided to leave the
place, but her master prevailed upon her to
stay until he had made a thorough search of
her room. Sure enough, in the corner of a cupboard
shelf, he came upon an old one-armed
doll, left there by a former servant. The
doll&#39;s arms were repaired, it was honourably
put away, and the restless little ghost was
laid.</p>

<p class="indent">Lafcadio Hearn says, &quot;I asked a charming
Japanese girl: &#39;How can a doll live?&#39; &#39;Why,&#39;
she answered, &#39;<i>if you love it enough</i>, it will
live.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But as all things earthly must have an end,
so even a Japanese doll at last comes to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
close of its life. It is lovingly cared for even
then, is not thrown away, is not buried, but is
consecrated to Kojin, a god with many arms.
A little shrine and a <i>torii</i> are erected in front
of the <i>enoki</i>-tree, in which Kojin is supposed
to live, and here the doll finds its last resting-place.</p>

<p class="indent">On the eighth of April is celebrated the religious
festival known as the Baptism of Buddha,
when crowds assemble at all the temples,
and pour <i>amacha</i>, or sweet tea, over the statue
of Buddha. In the centre of a small shrine
set up for the occasion is the image, adorned
with flowers and surrounded by small ladles to
be used by the worshippers. The right hand
of the image is uplifted toward heaven and the
left pointed downward toward the earth, &quot;in
interpretation of the famous utterance attributed
to Buddha at birth: &#39;Through all the
heights of heaven and all the depths of earth,
I alone am worthy of veneration.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The ceremony is said to have originated in
the effort to interpret the meaning of the <i>sutra</i>&mdash;a
Buddhist text&mdash;called Wash-Buddha-Virtuous-Action
<i>sutra</i>. In this we are told that
&quot;a disciple once asked Buddha how best to
enjoy the virtue ascribed to the Master both
in heaven and on earth.&quot; The answer was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
substance that the worshipper would find peace
by pouring a perfumed liquid over Buddha&#39;s
statue, and then sprinkling it upon his own
head. While performing the ceremony, the
devotee must repeat the golden text, &quot;Now
that we have washed our sacred Lord Buddha
clean, we pray that our own sins, both physical
and spiritual, may be cleansed away, and the
same we pray for all men.&quot; This festival is
an especial favourite with children, who throng
the temples, each one throwing a small copper
coin into the shrine and deluging the god with
sweet tea, which is usually a decoction of liquorice
and sugar in water.</p>

<p class="center">DISPLAY OF ARMOUR AND TOYS, BOYS&#39; FESTIVAL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">At the Boys&#39; Festival, on the fifth of May,
over every house where a boy has been born
during the year a bamboo pole is set up, from
which flies a paper carp, the fish moving in the
breeze as if ascending a stream. The carp is
the boldest of fish in braving the rapids, so to
Japanese boys he symbolizes ambitious striving.
In every household where there are sons
the favourite heroes of olden time are set out
in the alcove of honour of the guest-room.
Among them will be seen the figure of an archer
clothed from head to foot in gay armour, with
a huge bow in his hand and a quiver full of
arrows on his back. This is Yorimasa, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
famous knight, who was the greatest archer of
his time. On this day, too, pride of family and
veneration for ancestors are inculcated by
bringing out the antique dishes, the old armour
and the other heirlooms that during the rest
of the year are stored in the <i>godown</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The Gion Festival, on the seventh of June, in
honour of the mythical Prince Susa-no-o-no-mikoto
and his consort, Princess Inada, and
their son, Prince Yahashira, is famed for its
magnificent procession, in which the car of the
god is drawn. In the centre of the car is a
figure attired in rich brocades; in front is a
beautiful youth, who is accompanied by other
boys, all wearing crowns; at the back is the
orchestra that furnishes music for the procession.
This display is witnessed by crowds of
people, who throng the Shijo Road, in Kyoto,
where it occurs.</p>

<p class="indent">In ancient times it was customary to atone
for a crime by shaving the head and cutting
the nails of the fingers and toes. This custom
has now been modified to a sort of vicarious
atonement, called <i>harai</i>. <i>Gohei</i>, which in this
case is cut in the shape of a human figure, is
rubbed on the body of the evil-doer in order
that it may take his sins, and is then thrown
into the stream and carried away. Repentant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
sinners obtain <i>harai</i> from the priests of Shinto
temples.</p>

<p class="indent">This ceremony, which occurs in June and is
called the Festival of the Misogi, is referred
to in the following old song:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Up Nara&#39;s stream</span><br />
<span class="i2">The evening wind is blowing;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Down Nara&#39;s stream</span><br />
<span class="i2">The Misogi is going:</span><br />
<span class="i0">So Summer has come, I know!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">A festival of fairy-land is the <i>Itsukushima</i>,
celebrated at Miyajima, on the Inland Sea, from
the fifteenth to the seventeenth of June. Brilliant
decorations are everywhere&mdash;on the long
avenue by which the shrine is approached, and
over the water, where bamboo-trees have been
set up, and flags and lanterns are hung from
them. Musicians in three boats furnish music
for the assembled crowds. The place is
thronged by thousands on the last day of the
festival, when the boats with the musicians are
stationed under the great <i>torii</i>, and the sweet
sounds floating over the water and the myriad
lights reflected in the sea make the scene one
of indescribable enchantment.</p>

<p class="indent">On the seventh of July occurs the <i>Tanabata
Matsuri</i>, or Festival of the Stars, which, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
so many other Japanese customs, was introduced
from China. A charming nature myth
tells us that beside the East River of Heaven,
the Milky Way, lived the fair Princess Tanabata,
who was known to the human race as the
star Vega. She was a weaver by profession.
As she was obliged to marry in order to fulfill
her destiny, Heaven chose for her the great
male star, Kengyu (Aquila), whose abode was
on the West River. In her happiness the Princess
forgot her weaving; whereat Heaven was
so displeased that she was sent back in disgrace
to the East River, and ever after was
allowed to see her husband only once a year.
All devout Japanese pray for fine weather on
July seventh, as that is the date on which the
unfortunate lovers meet; for, if even a few
drops of rain fall, the East River will rise above
its banks and prevent the Princess from crossing
to her waiting spouse.</p>

<p class="indent">On the evening of this day, the young maidens
of the family lay a straw matting in the garden,
and place on it a table with fruits and cakes
as offerings to the two stars. Then they present
their petitions for themselves and their
true loves. Some pray for long life and a large
family; others set up a bamboo pole, on which
they hang a piece of embroidery as an emblem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
of their desire for skill in needlework; still
others attach to the pole pieces of paper, on
which are written the poems they bring in
praise of the heavenly couple. This festival
has scant observance in large cities.</p>

<p class="indent">Touched with a peculiar tenderness and pathos
is the Festival of the Dead, observed from
the thirteenth to the fifteenth of July. In every
house new mats of rice straw are laid before
the little shrines, and a tiny meal is set out for
the spirits of the departed. When evening
comes, the streets are brilliant with flaming
torches, and lanterns are hung in every doorway.
Those whose friends have only lately left
them make this night a true memorial to their
dead, going out to the cemeteries, where they
offer prayers, burn incense, light lanterns and
fill bamboo vases with the flowers they have
brought. On the evening of the third day the
Ghosts of the Circle of Penance are fed, and
those who have no friends living to remember
them. Then on every streamlet, every river,
lake and bay of Japan&mdash;except in the largest
seaports, where it is now forbidden&mdash;appear
fleets of tiny boats, bearing gifts of food and
loving farewells. The light of a miniature lantern
at its bow and blue wreaths of smoke from
burning incense mark the course of each little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
vessel. In these fairy craft the spirits take
their departure for the land of the hereafter.</p>

<p class="indent">In September occurs the Moon Festival,
which appears to have no religious significance
whatever, but to be simply an occasion for
enjoying the beauty of the moon. It was doubtless
borrowed from the Chinese in the eighth
century, and is still celebrated in some places.
The ancient Chinese, however, observed it in
solemn fashion, going to the top of some pagoda
and writing poems about the Queen of the
Night, but the Japanese of olden times combined
with pure æsthetic enjoyment the pleasures
of actual feasting. They used to gather
in the garden of some restaurant by a lake or
river, where a banquet of rice dumplings, boiled
potatoes and beans was set out, and enjoyed
at the same time the good food and the scene
before them.</p>

<p class="indent">Also in September is the Ayaha Festival, in
honour of the two Chinese women who first
taught weaving to the Japanese, many centuries
ago. These teachers died in September,
and on the seventeenth of that month cotton
and hempen fabrics are offered to their
spirits at the shrines built in their honour.</p>

<p class="indent">At the temple of the goddess Amaterasu-Omikami,
near Shiba Park, Tokyo, the Shinmei
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
Feast is observed from the eleventh to the
twenty-first of September. This is especially
the time to offer the petition, &quot;O God, make
clean our hearts within us,&quot; hence much ginger
is sold, the plant being supposed to prevent
impurity. A sweetmeat called <i>ame</i> is sold in
cypress-wood baskets, curved like the roofs of
ancient shrines. Cypress is held sacred because
the roof-trees of old shrines were made of it,
and is supposed to have the power of warding
off diseases.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the most curious of all Japanese festivals
is the Laughing Festival of Wasa, celebrated
in October. A procession is formed of
old men carrying boxes full of oranges and
persimmons impaled on sharpened sticks, followed
by children with the same kinds of fruits
on bamboo rods. On reaching the shrine, the
leader turns round and makes up a comical face,
which is greeted with shouts of laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">According to the legend, the gods, once upon
a time, met in the great temple at Izumo to
consider the love affairs of the kingdom. When
all were seated, one alone, Miwa-Daimyo-jin,
was missing, and although search was made, he
could not be found. Now, this god was so deaf
that he had misunderstood the day appointed
for the assembly, and he appeared at Izumo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
only after all was over. The Laughing Festival
commemorates the laughter of the gods
when they heard of poor Miwa-Daimyo-jin&#39;s
mistake.</p>

<p class="indent">Another October celebration is held in memory
of Nichiren, called the Luther of Japan,
who endeavoured to purify Buddhism from the
superstitions that had crept into it. He was
the founder of the sect named for him. On
October thirteenth great numbers of his disciples
assemble at Ikegami, the place of his death,
near Tokyo, carrying lanterns and banners, and
reciting a <i>sutra</i> in concert.</p>

<p class="indent">A curious feast is observed by merchants on
the twentieth of October in honour of Ebisu,
one of the seven gods of good luck, who is especially
the guardian genius of tradesmen. They
invite their friends and relatives to a banquet,
upon which a large picture of the god looks
down from the wall. Fishes, called <i>tai</i>, are laid
before this picture as offerings, and are also
eaten by the guests. After the feast has proceeded
a little way, sport begins. Perhaps one
of the guests starts an auction of the dishes
before him, his companions bidding up to thousands
of <i>yen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the joke continuing until it runs
itself out. This little buying and selling episode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
is to emphasize the fact that it is a merchants&#39;
festival that is being celebrated.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a>

<span class="label">[6]</span></a>
The <i>yen</i> is fifty cents.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The present Emperor&#39;s birthday is the thirty-first
of August, but henceforth it is to be celebrated
on the thirty-first of October, which
brings it very near to the third of November,
the late Emperor&#39;s birthday, so long a holiday
all over Japan. Although this is one of the
annual festivities, the celebration is so largely
official and diplomatic that I have described it
among Court Functions.</p>

<p class="indent">The fall <i>matsuri</i> in Tokyo is held early in
November at the Shokonsha, a temple sacred
to the memory of the patriots who have given
their lives for their country. It is especially
a soldiers&#39; festival, and is the occasion when
the garrison comes in a body to worship at this
shrine. The troops form by divisions in front
of the temple and salute, presenting arms while
the bugles sound a sacred call. Afterward
the soldiers have a race-meeting on a half-mile
track, which is made very amusing by the
rivalry between the different divisions and the
mad careerings of the little horses. This is a
large <i>matsuri</i>, and the booths of peddlers and
mountebanks line the streets for blocks.</p>

<p class="indent">November eighth is the day of the <i>Fuigo
Matsuri</i>, when thanks are returned to the god
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
of fire, who invented the bellows&mdash;<i>Fuigo</i> meaning
bellows. As the centre of the worship of
this god is in Kyoto, it is observed to a greater
extent there than elsewhere, beginning in a curious
way, by opening the windows before sunrise
and throwing out quantities of oranges to
the children who are always waiting outside.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese counterpart of our New England
Thanksgiving occurs the twenty-third of
November, when the Emperor is the chief celebrant,
making an offering of the new rice of the
year before the shrine of his ancestors, and in
behalf of the nation uttering a prayer of thanksgiving
and a plea for protection. After presenting
this offering His Majesty partakes of
a sacred feast, consisting of the first fruits of
the year, and the next day he invites the highest
officials of the State to a grand banquet at
the palace.</p>

<p class="indent">Near the end of December comes the <i>Kamado-harai</i>
Feast of the Oven. The <i>kamado</i> is the
fire-box on which the food is cooked, and it has
a god of its own. As the year draws to a close,
the god of the <i>kamado</i> carries to heaven a report
of the conduct of the household during the
twelve months. So the priests are called in to
pray the oven-god that he will give as favourable
an account as possible. As modern stoves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
are now taking the place of the old <i>kamado</i> to
some extent, this feast is less observed in the
larger cities than in the country districts.</p>

<p class="indent">At a shrine in Shimonoseki the festival of
<i>Wakamegari-no Shinji</i> is observed on the
thirty-first of December. A flight of stone steps
leads through a stone <i>torii</i> down into the sea
far below the lowest tide-mark. The Shinto
priests, in full robes, are obliged to descend
these steps on the feast-day until they reach
and cut some of the seaweed (<i>wakame</i>), which
they offer at the temple the next day. Japanese
legend relates that the Empress Jingo sailed
from this spot to the conquest of Korea, bearing
two jewels that were given her by the god of
this shrine. When off the Korean coast, she
threw one jewel into the water, and a flood tide
at once bore her ships high up on the shore;
then she tossed the other gem into the waves,
and the swift ebbing of the tide left the fleet
safely stranded.</p>

<h2><a name="chVIII" id="chVIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="h3">CULTS AND SHRINES</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;He that practiseth righteousness receiveth a blessing;
it cometh as surely as the shadow followeth the man.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illo_226.jpg" width="100" height="114" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE quotation at the head of this chapter
is of especial interest, because it reminds
one so much of a precept from
the Bible. It is taken from a little
Japanese text-book of ethics, which is ascribed
to a Buddhist abbot of the ninth century.</p>

<p class="indent">There are two distinct but perfectly harmonious
forms of non-Christian belief in Japan to-day&mdash;Shinto
and Buddhism&mdash;which dovetail
so well that each one contributes something of
value to the Japanese character. The Confucian
philosophy, also, had its share in developing
<i>Bushido</i>, the &quot;Soul of the People.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Shinto is the native religion of Japan, and
both because it is so little known outside of that
country and because a study of it goes so far
to explain many national characteristics, it
seems worth while to consider it at some length.
The word Shinto may be translated as the Way
of the Gods, and defined in brief as a worship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
of ancestors, especially of the Emperor and his
forebears. Human beings are believed to be
the children of the sunshine, and sin is hardly
recognized.</p>

<p class="indent">Shinto is a combination of primitive instincts.
It is based on hero worship, and it has myriads
of deities, who live in every conceivable object,
from the spirit of the sewing-needle to the gods
of thunder and lightning, or of the sun, moon
and stars. &quot;The weakness of Shinto,&quot; says
Dr. Nitobe, the eloquent exponent of Japanese
beliefs, &quot;lies in the non-recognition of human
frailty, of sin.&quot; The sum total of its moral
teaching is this, &quot;Be pure in heart and body.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Shinto idea seems to be that it is only
necessary to act out the natural impulses of
the heart in order to be pure. But where there
is no sense of sin, there can be no consciousness
of need, no incentive to higher things. Shinto
lacks ideals. It allies itself with the practical
affairs of every-day life, inculcating industry
and personal cleanliness, some of its sects
even prescribing mountain-climbing and abdominal
respiration as religious duties. But,
as it has no theology, it offers no explanation
of the great problems of the universe; and,
having no sacred writings, it has no authority
on which to base a system of ethics. Theology
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
and the spiritual element in religion came to
Japan with Buddhism; while ethics was the
gift of Confucianism.</p>

<p class="indent">The first sign of a Shinto temple is the
<i>torii</i>. This peculiar gateway, though originally
erected only by the Shintoists, has been adopted
by the Buddhists, who have changed it by turning
up the corners of the top beam and adding
inscriptions and ornament. Passing under the
<i>torii</i> you stand before the huge gate, generally
painted red, guarded by wooden figures, or
keepers. These are supposed to be Ni-o&mdash;two
gigantic and fierce kings&mdash;and they occupy a
sort of cage with wire in front, that stands on
either side of the entrance. Every worshipper
makes a wish as he enters the temple, and
throws at the kings little wads of paper precisely
like the spitballs of school children. If
the wads go through the wire, the wishes are
supposed to come true.</p>

<p class="indent">The temple itself stands in a courtyard inside
the gate, and is rather plain and undecorated,
much like Japanese houses. A flight of steps
leads up to a balcony on the front, there is matting
upon the floor inside, and an altar in the
centre supports a big bronze vase, which usually
contains pieces of gold paper, called <i>gohei</i>. A
mirror is the most important article in a Shinto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
shrine, the idea being that it is a symbol of the
human heart, which should reflect the image of
Deity as the glass reflects the face of the worshipper.
The mirror is not found in the temples
of merely local divinities, but only in those
sacred to the Sun-Goddess herself, and even
there is not exposed to view. Wrapped in a
series of brocade bags&mdash;another being added
as each in turn wears out&mdash;and kept in a box
of cypress wood, which is enclosed in a wooden
cage under silken coverings, the mirror itself
is never visible to the eyes of the curious.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">GRAND SHRINE OF ISE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Two famous Shinto shrines&mdash;at Ise and Kitzuki&mdash;are
especially revered on account of
their great age. Kitzuki is so ancient that no
one knows when it was founded. According to
tradition, the first temple was built by direct
command of the Sun-Goddess herself, in the
days when none but gods existed. The approach
to the sacred enclosure is most imposing.
A beautiful avenue, shaded by huge trees and
spanned by a series of gigantic <i>torii</i>, leads from
a magnificent bronze <i>torii</i> at the entrance to
the massive wall that surrounds the temple
courts. Within are groves and courts and immense
buildings. The people are not admitted
to the great shrine itself, but offer their petitions
before the Haiden, or Hall of Prayer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
Each pilgrim throws money into the box before
the door, claps his hands four times, bows his
head, and remains for a few minutes, then
passes out. So many thousands throng this
court that&mdash;to borrow Hearn&#39;s figure&mdash;the
sound of their clapping is like the surf breaking
on the shore.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the shrine at Kitzuki is the oldest,
the temples at Ise are more venerated. The
inner shrine itself is a plain wooden building
set within successive courts, but stately cryptomerias
and the most magnificent camphor
groves in all Japan give the place an unusual
air of grandeur and sanctity.</p>

<p class="indent">Wedding and funeral customs are extremely
interesting. They have both the religious and
the civil marriage in Japan. To make it legal,
the parents must sign in the register. Marriages
in Shinto temples have been unusual
until recently, as they have generally taken
place in the home. The custom is changing
now, and temple weddings are becoming more
frequent. Funeral customs are changing also.
Formerly it was always the Buddhist priest
who conducted the burial service, now the aristocrats
are interred according to Shinto rites.</p>

<p class="indent">At a wedding that we witnessed in a Shinto
temple the couple first listened to a sermon by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
the priest, then they were given tapers at the
altar. The bride lighted her candle first, and
the bridegroom lighted his from hers. After
this the two tapers were put together in such a
way that they burned as one, symbolizing the
perfect unity of wedded life. The bride was
handsomely dressed&mdash;the <i>obis</i> for these occasions
sometimes cost over one hundred dollars&mdash;and
wore the headdress with horns, half hidden
by a veil called the &quot;horn-hider.&quot; This
name would seem to refer to the Buddhist text,
&quot;A woman&#39;s exterior is that of a saint, but
her heart is that of a demon.&quot; After the marriage
ceremony, the bridal party was photographed
in the temple courtyard in a decidedly
up-to-date fashion. At the house the bridal
couple drank the nuptial <i>saké</i>, which had been
prepared by two girl friends of the bride. This
was poured from a gold lacquer vessel into one
of silver lacquer&mdash;the two representing husband
and wife&mdash;then into a cup, which the
master of ceremonies handed to the bride and
afterward to the groom, and from which they
both drank.</p>

<p class="indent">As Shinto is the faith of the reigning family,
the funeral ceremony of a prince throws a good
deal of light upon the cult itself. I did not
witness such a ceremony myself, so I condense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
the vivid description given by the Baroness
d&#39;Anethan, who, as wife of the Belgian Minister,
resided in Tokyo for many years.</p>

<p class="indent">The funeral procession was headed by over
eighty bearers dressed in white, the Japanese
sign of mourning, each carrying a huge tower
of flowers. Following these were officers in
uniform holding cushions, on which rested the
Prince&#39;s numerous grand crosses and orders.
Next came various persons surrounding a casket,
which contained the favourite food, the
shoes for the journey (large wooden <i>geta</i>), the
sword to guard against evil spirits during the
soul&#39;s fifty days&#39; wanderings, and the money
to pay for the ferry-boat that crosses the river
to Eternity. Finally appeared a beautifully
fabricated casket of pure white wood (the
Shinto sign of purity), embossed with the
family arms in gold, in which the body was
arranged in a sitting position. The chief
mourner, a young prince, was dressed in the
old-fashioned Court mourning, consisting of a
wide, full, black silk petticoat, covered partially
by a short white kimono, crowned by an unusual
form of headdress, made of what looked like
stiff black muslin. The two princesses of the
family also wore ancient Court mourning&mdash;a
greyish-brown <i>hakama</i> (a kind of divided skirt)&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
had their black hair puffed out at the
sides like great wings and hanging down the
back.</p>

<p class="indent">Arriving at the cemetery, the Corps Diplomatique
walked up a path paved in wood and
bordered on each side by covered seats, at the
end of which were high trestles supporting the
coffin. The service now began, accompanied by
weird funeral music. Low white wooden tables
were placed before the coffin, all sorts of objects
being offered to the departed by the
priests. First was a long box, containing the
name which His Imperial Highness was to bear
in the next world. After this followed a repast
of various kinds of fish, game, sweetmeats and
fruit&mdash;the favourite foods of the deceased.
These articles were handed with great ceremony
from one priest to another. There were
ten priests, and as each one took the dish, which
was placed on a stool of white wood, he clapped
his hands twice to call the gods, and the last
priest, bowing very low, finally set it on the
table. After all the food had been deposited,
prayers were intoned from an immense scroll,
the final ceremony being that each member of
the family, and after them, the Corps Diplomatique,
approached the coffin, carrying
branches of some particular tree, from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
floated long papers inscribed with prayers.
The actual interment took place some hours
later, and with the remains of the Prince were
buried the various articles of food and clothing.</p>

<p class="indent">Our visits to the cemeteries showed us the
veneration of the Japanese for their noble dead,
and impressed us with the significance of ancestor
worship in the Shinto cult. The big
graveyard in Tokyo, where Nogi and his wife
were buried, was most interesting. Modern
cemeteries in Japan are much like ours, each
owner having an enclosed lot and misshapen
stones or stone lanterns to mark the graves,
but they are not so well kept up as in America.
Attached to the fence surrounding the lot is a
wooden box, in which visitors leave their cards
when calling at the abode of the dead. The
mourners sometimes burn incense and leave
branches of laurel, too. As we approached the
resting-place of Nogi and his wife, we saw
crowds of people standing near, for although
months had passed since their dramatic death,
the Japanese were still visiting their graves in
great numbers.</p>

<p class="indent">In many cemeteries are the statues of &quot;The
Six Jizo&quot;&mdash;smiling, childish figures about
three feet high&mdash;bearing various Buddhist emblems.
A bag of pebbles hangs about the neck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
of each one, and little heaps of stones are piled
up at their feet and even laid upon their shoulders
and their knees. Jizo is the children&#39;s god.
He is the protector of the little souls who have
gone from this world to the Sai-no-Kawara, the
abode of children after death, where they must
pile up stones in penance for their sins! When
this task is done, the demons abuse them and
throw down their little towers; then the babies
run to Jizo, who hides them in his great sleeves,
and drives the evil spirits away. Every stone
that is laid at the feet of Jizo is a help to some
little one in working out its long task.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn gives an interesting account of a wonderful
cave at Kaka, on the wild western coast
of Japan, which can be visited only when there
is not wind enough &quot;to move three hairs,&quot; for
the strongest boat could not live in the surf
that beats against the high cliffs and dashes
into the fissures in their sides. But let one
make the journey safely, and he shall find in
this grotto an image of Jizo, and before it the
tiny stone heaps. Every night, it is said, baby
souls make their way to the cavern, and pile
up the pebbles around their friend, and every
morning the prints of little bare feet&mdash;the feet
of the baby ghosts&mdash;are seen in the moist sand.</p>

<p class="indent">Buddhism has become so complicated and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
changed in the different countries through
which it has travelled since it originated in
Southern India, and there are to-day so many
sects, that it is difficult to define.</p>

<p class="indent">The Ikko sect undoubtedly holds the purest
and loftiest form of this faith. Its chief teaching
is, that &quot;man is to be saved by faith in
the merciful power of Amida, and not by works
or vain repetition of prayers. For this reason,
and also because its priests are permitted to
marry, this body has sometimes been called the
Protestantism of Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All the followers of Buddha believe in reincarnation;
they feel that life is a struggle,
which human beings must get through with as
well as they can, and that as they are frail,
they return to this earth in various forms in
punishment for their sins, always toiling on,
until at last their purified souls merge in the
Divine and realize calm. As an old Japanese
writer puts it, &quot;Though growing in the foulest
slime, the flower remains pure and undefiled.
And the soul of him who remains pure in the
midst of temptation is likened unto the lotus.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There have been many Buddhas, who have
returned at different times to this world, Yamisaki
being the latest. Buddhism has degenerated
in Japan, having absorbed the Shinto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
gods, and as it is based on a pessimistic view
of life, it appears to be rather a depressing
religion.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><i>Lacquer Work</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Buddhist temples are adorned with wonderful
carving and lacquer work, and contain
bronzes and golden Buddhas. One of the
largest and most magnificent in Japan, surrounded
by gardens of great extent and beauty,
is the Eastern Hongwanji temple in Kyoto.
The shrines of the Ikko sect are called Hongwanji,
meaning &quot;Monastery of the Real Vow,&quot;
from the vow made by Amida that he would
not become Buddha unless salvation was
granted to all who sincerely desired it and
testified their wish by calling upon his name
ten times. There is no government fund for
this shrine, and it has no regular source of
income, yet it has been the recipient of munificent
gifts from royal personages and men of
wealth, and has all the prestige that could come
from temporal support and the sanction of
government.</p>

<p class="indent">When we visited this temple, we were ceremoniously
received by the priest in charge and
a number of his confrères. The head priest,
short, fat and clean-shaven, who met us at the
gate, grunted and drew the air through his teeth
in greeting us, as a symbol of great politeness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
and respect. His costume was a black silk robe
over a soft white under-garment, and a gold
brocade band about his neck.</p>

<p class="indent">As we passed into the building, we were told
that the present structure, which is said to have
cost seven million <i>yen</i> and was sixteen years
in building, was erected on the site of an ancient
temple that had been destroyed by fire.
It is noteworthy that the new temple contains
a system of tile pipes in the roof and ceiling,
from which, in case of fire, water may be
dropped over the entire area.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">EASTERN HONGWANJI TEMPLE, KYOTO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Before the altar is a broad sweep of stone
flooring, and in front of that a railing, outside
which the people come to worship. Several
were kneeling there as we passed, their palms
together in the traditional attitude of Christian
prayer. Others were prone on the floor.
The ragged, the lame and the desolate, blind
and deaf to the passing crowd, knelt upon this
bare stone pavement&mdash;separated from the
altar by a railing beyond which they might not
pass&mdash;their hands lifted in supplication or
adoration, their heads bowed in humility. The
scene called to mind the legend of Sandalphon,
the Angel of Prayer, whose mission Longfellow
has so beautifully described. We looked at the
silent god standing within the lotus&mdash;sacred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
emblem of humanity&mdash;veiled by the pervading
incense, and we wondered how many of those
unspoken prayers penetrated to the mysterious
depths where Buddha dwells.</p>

<p class="indent">To the left of the altar is a space reserved
for the priesthood, where Buddhist monks come
daily to their morning devotions and religious
exercises. Although the priests do not live in
the temple, they sometimes pass the night here
in meditation, seated on the long rows of mats
that we saw arranged in orderly fashion. About
forty priests are usually in attendance at the
morning services, but on occasions of State
ceremony larger numbers gather from all parts
of the Empire. On the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth
of each month services are held in memory
of the founders of the temple.</p>

<p class="indent">The priests conducted us between the railing
and the altar, bowing their heads as they
passed. A number of small coins were scattered
on the matting&mdash;these were offerings
left by worshippers. Our hosts, who treated
us with unfailing courtesy, pointed out further
details of the building, and afterward took us
to a room where we were served with tea and
small cakes. We were told that this apartment
had been donated by the present Emperor.</p>

<p class="indent">We followed one of the priests into the walled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
garden and through its narrow paths. We
crossed brooks on bamboo bridges, and looked
into the calm waters. Among the trees were
small temples and tea-houses overhanging the
water, and curiously shaped stones and crooked
pines. Hongwanji garden has all the fascination
of a true Japanese garden, and has, besides,
the additional charm of age, for it is over
three hundred years old. We sat in this ideal
spot, in one of the pretty tea-houses with its
soft mats and lacquer and polished wood, and
again drank tea from wee porcelain cups and
ate sugared cakes.</p>

<p class="indent">The memory of this temple garden clings to
me still. I imagine the priests sitting on the
little covered wooden bridge gazing into the
calm water with the lotus flowers, while the
crickets sing in the silence&mdash;crickets who were
perhaps once human, now doing penance for
their sins. I hear the priests murmur over and
over <i>Namu Amida Butsu</i>, the Japanese rendering
of the Sanskrit invocation meaning &quot;Hail
to the Eternal Splendour of Buddha!&quot; I see
them meditating on the unending life that they
believe to be in store for them, until evil shall
have left them, and they shall be absorbed into
Nirvana, &quot;as a dewdrop sinks into the shining
sea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
As we left the temple we were shown the
great coil of ropes made of human hair. There
were originally twenty-nine of these cables, the
longest of which measured two hundred feet.
It seems that at the time when the old shrine
was burned, and they wished to rebuild it, the
church had no funds. People came together
from all over the Empire, and set to work like
beavers. The men gave what they could, in
work and money; the women had nothing, yet
they, too, wished to help. In a frenzy of religious
zeal they cut off their hair&mdash;their most
treasured possession&mdash;and cast it at the foot
of the shrine of Buddha. From their offerings
were woven the cables that hoisted the tiles to
the roof and lifted into place the great wooden
pillars of the temple.</p>

<p class="indent">The temple of Buddha, with its unpainted
exterior, its bare pillars in their naked simplicity,
its glint of gold, its magnificent carvings,
the delicate fragrance of burning incense,
its candles, its wealth of symbolism&mdash;all this
is a fading memory; yet its fascination lingers.
We wonder how much of the temple of Buddha
we really saw, how much we felt the presence
of that power which is so intimately linked with
the spirit of the East and with the genius of
the Oriental peoples. We felt the reverence&mdash;unexpressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
in word or outward act&mdash;with
which our hosts, the priests, drew our attention
to the inscription above the altar, painted
in golden Japanese characters by the hand of
the late Emperor, which, being interpreted,
means, &quot;See Truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The temples at Nikko, the finest in Japan,
are part Shinto, part Buddhist. A ceremony
which we once witnessed there, in the mausoleum
of Iyeyasu, the great Shogun, was full of
interest. After taking off our shoes at the
entrance, we wandered over the mats, looking
at the gloriously carved panels, till we were
informed that all was ready and were invited
to enter an inner room. I was given a peach-coloured
brocade robe, which I threw over my
shoulders, but was told that it was not necessary
to don the skirt, which forms the rest of
the ceremonial costume. They gave us two
camp-chairs, as we preferred to sit on them
rather than on our heels, in Japanese fashion.
On either side of us squatted three priests in
white and green robes with curious black openwork
hats on their heads. We faced the inner
shrine, in which stood, on a table, a vase containing
the gold paper for purification, such as
is seen in Shinto shrines.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 541px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">THE HONDEN, IYEYASU, NIKKO.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">Then began the most unearthly music that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
have ever heard, made by the three priests on
L.&#39;s side, who were musicians. One had a
strange instrument made of flutes put together,
resembling a small organ, which gave out a
sound somewhat like a bagpipe. While this
man played a weird tune on his pipes, another
with a different instrument made a most unpleasant
whistle, like that of a train, which
continued throughout the entire ceremony.</p>

<p class="indent">Besides the green-robed musicians there were
on my side white-robed priests with even
quainter head-gear, who moved about on their
knees and presented food and drink before the
altar with many bows and much clapping of
their hands. This service led to the opening
of the door of the inner shrine, into which we
were afterward taken and served with <i>saké</i>.
Then we were conducted behind one beautiful
set of painted screens after another till we
came into the innermost place, gloriously decorated
in lacquer and painting but in absolute
darkness, except for the glow of the lanterns
which we took with us. On emerging from
these hidden recesses, we left the temple, with
polite bows to the priests and thanks for their
courtesy. As we walked away from the building,
we could hear the screeching instruments,
the priests going on with the service as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
offerings were brought out of the sacred
place.</p>

<p class="indent">Just as we were departing, I was given this
translation of the Precepts of Iyeyasu, which
I have been glad to preserve as a souvenir
of beautiful Nikko:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">PRECEPTS OF IYEYASU</p>

<p class="indent">Life is like unto a long journey with a heavy
load. Let thy steps be slow and steady, that
thou stumble not. Persuade thyself that imperfection
and inconvenience is the natural lot
of mortals, and there will be no room for discontent,
neither for despair. When ambitious
desires arise in thy heart, recall the days of
extremity thou hast passed through. Forbearance
is the root of quietness and assurance for
ever. Look upon wrath as thy enemy. If thou
knowest only what it is to conquer, and knowest
not what it is to be defeated, woe unto thee!
it will fare ill with thee. Find fault with thyself
rather than with others. Better the less
than the more.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Translated by Prof. K. Wadagaki,<br />
of the Imperial University.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The Japanese, like Arabs and Hindoos, not
content with worshipping at near-by shrines,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
often make pilgrimages to holy places at a distance.
There are several of these resorts in
the Empire, some of the most famous being
the temple of the Sun-Goddess at Ise, the holy
mountain Fuji, the monastery of Koya-san,
and the lovely island of Miyajima, in the Inland
Sea. As most of the pilgrims belong to the
artisan and peasant classes, and have scarcely
more than enough for their daily needs, they
have evolved a scheme for defraying the expenses
of these trips by forming a great number
of associations, or brotherhoods, the members
of which contribute each a cent a month.
At the proper season for the pilgrimage certain
members are chosen by lot to represent the
brotherhood at some shrine, and their expenses
are paid out of the common fund. No distinctive
dress is worn by most of them, but those
on their way to Fuji and other mountains are
attired in white garments and broad straw
hats.</p>

<p class="indent">These Japanese pilgrims are not only performing
a pious duty, they are also taking their
summer vacation. After their prayers are
said, as at the various festivals I have described,
they do not hesitate to join in all the
amusements that are provided. It makes little
difference to the mass of the common people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
whether they worship at a Shinto or a Buddhist
shrine, and the Government actually changed
Kompira from Buddhist to Shinto without in
the least detracting from its popularity. The
relics guarded in these temples of Buddha
remind us very much of the sacred memorials
cherished by the Roman Church&mdash;holy garments,
holy swords, pictures by famous saints,
and bits of the cremated body of a Buddha.</p>

<p class="indent">It was from her religions that Japan drew
her Knightly Code, <i>Bushido</i>, obedience to which
raised the <i>samurai</i> from the mere brutal
wielder of swords to the chivalrous warrior.
From Shinto he imbibed veneration for his
ancestors, the strongest possible sense of duty
to his parents, and the most self-sacrificing loyalty
to the sovereign. Buddhism gave him a
stoical composure in the presence of danger, a
contempt for life, and &quot;friendliness with
death.&quot; It made him calm and self-contained.
Finally, the <i>samurai</i> obtained from the teachings
of Confucius his principles of action
toward his fellow men.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Bushido</i> is spoken of as &quot;the Soul of the
People.&quot; The Greeks of old located the soul
in the kidneys, the Romans in the heart, and
it is only in recent years that it has been described
as in the head; even then the soul at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
best is indefinable, so I am at a loss to tell
exactly what <i>Bushido</i> means.</p>

<p class="indent">When I asked a Japanese to define <i>Bushido</i>,
he answered, &quot;Loyalty&mdash;the loyalty of the
servant to his master, of the son to his father.
The servant is willing to make any sacrifice for
the master. The Forty-Seven Ronins are an
example of this. General Nogi is another instance
of the same thing. Nogi felt that his
death would remind the younger generation of
the Spartan virtues of the older days, which
they were forgetting, and would be a good thing
for the country. He also wished to die in order
that his master, the Emperor, might not be
lonely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese national hymn, as translated
by Professor Chamberlain, fitly embodies this
sentiment of loyalty to the Emperor:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;A thousand years of happy reign be thine;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rule on, my lord, till what are pebbles now</span><br />
<span class="i0">By age united, to mighty rocks shall grow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whose venerable sides the moss doth line.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Among the rare jewels of race and civilization
which have slowly grown to perfection is
the Japanese virtue of loyalty,&quot; writes Dr.
W. E. Griffis; &quot;In supreme devotion, in utter
consecration to his master, in service, through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
life and death, a <i>samurai&#39;s</i> loyalty to his lord
knew no equal.... Wife, children, fortune,
health, friends, were as naught&mdash;but rather to
be trampled under foot, if necessary, in order
to reach that &#39;last supreme measure of devotion&#39;
which the <i>samurai</i> owed to his lord. The
matchless sphere of rock crystal, flawless and
perfect, is the emblem of Japanese loyalty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The material side of <i>Bushido</i> is the fighting
spirit, and the germ of the spiritual side is the
idea of fair play in fight&mdash;a germ which developed
into a lofty code of honour. In feudal
times Japanese warriors endured severe discipline.
They were obliged to be expert with
the fencing-stick, skilled in <i>jiu-jutsu</i>, the aristocratic
form of wrestling, in archery, and in
the use of the spear and the iron fan, as well
as the double sword. They felt that mastery
of the art of battle gave self-control and mental
calm.</p>

<p class="indent">Mental exercises were practised more generally
in olden times than they are to-day.
There are several cults for the training of the
mind, such as <i>Kiai</i> and <i>Zen</i>, both Buddhist
practices. The secret of <i>Kiai</i> condensed is:
&quot;I make personality my magic power. I make
promptitude my limbs. I make self-protection
my laws.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
<i>Zen</i> teaches: &quot;Commit no evil, do only good,
and preserve the purity of your heart and will.
If you keep aloof from mundane fame and the
lusts of the flesh, and are inspired by a firm
resolve to attain the Great Truth, the gates of
Stoicism will be opened to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Bushido</i> is the foundation of the nation, built
of rock. It is strong and true, and whatever
is built upon it in the future, even if it topple
and fall, can always be rebuilt again, for the
rock is there for ever. May they build something
worthy to rise on such a firm foundation!</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Old and the New Japan jostle each
other at every turn. One day we visited
the tomb of the heroic Nogi, who
sacrificed his life on the altar of <i>Bushido</i>,
and the next we received at the Embassy
the pupils of the Tokyo Normal School, who will
have so large a share in the continued remodelling
of the nation. The Land of the Rising
Sun has undergone decided changes within the
last fifty years in her desire to make herself
the equal of the Great Powers of Christendom;
she has been willing to cast aside tradition, to
modify her form of government, to adopt Western
customs. But none of these things appears
to me so vital as the reconstruction of her educational
system and the free admission of a
new religious belief.</p>

<p class="indent">The old system of Japanese education was
derived from Chinese models as early as the
eighth century, but for many hundred years it
was barely kept alive in Buddhist monasteries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
and was never fully carried out until the Tokugawa
period. The higher institutions were
devoted entirely to the study of Chinese history
and literature, and their object was chiefly
to train efficient servants of the State. Buddhist
priests were the usual teachers of the
lower classes, but retired <i>samurai</i> often opened
elementary schools, such as that pictured so
vividly by one of their pupils:<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>

Dr. Nitobe, in &quot;The Japanese Nation.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;This primitive school,&quot; he says, &quot;consisted
of a couple of rooms, where some twenty
or thirty boys (and a very few girls), ranging
in age from seven to fourteen, spent the forenoon,
each reading in turn with the teacher for
half an hour some paragraphs from Confucius
and Mencius, and devoting the rest of the time
to calligraphy. Of the three R&#39;s, &#39;riting demanded
the most time and reading but little,
&#39;rithmetic scarcely any, except in a school attended
by children of the common people as
distinct from those of the <i>samurai</i>. Sons of
the <i>samurai</i> class had other curricula than the
three R&#39;s. They began fencing, <i>jiu-jutsu</i>,
spear-practice and horsemanship, when quite
young, and usually took these lessons in the
early morning. As a child of seven, I remember
being roused by my mother before dawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
in the winter, and reluctantly, often in positively
bad humour, picking my way barefooted
through the snow. The idea was to accustom
children to hardihood and endurance. There
was little fun in the schoolroom, except such
as our ingenious minds devised behind our
teacher&#39;s back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yet this primitive system of education
trained leaders of sufficient wisdom, unselfishness
and breadth of view to guide Japan safely
from the old to the new. Okubo and Kido, two
members of the embassy that was sent to the
treaty powers in 1871, discovered, upon landing
in San Francisco, that the very bell-boys and
waiters in the hotel understood the issues at
stake in the election then going on. This convinced
them that nothing but education could
enable Japan to hold her own beside the Western
world. Okubo said, &quot;We must first educate
leaders, and the rest will follow.&quot; Kido
said, &quot;We must educate the masses; for unless
the people are trained, they cannot follow
their leaders.&quot; Between the two, they got
something of both.</p>

<p class="indent">The younger generation lost no time in availing
themselves of their new privileges, and indeed
they are to-day so eager for learning that,
after their daily work, many of them sit up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
greater part of the night to study. In consequence,
they often grow anæmic, nervous and
melancholy.</p>

<p class="indent">While the Japanese seem now to have
adapted their elementary schools to the needs
of their people, they have not been so successful
with their secondary schools, called &quot;middle&quot;
for boys and &quot;high&quot; for girls. The
course of study for boys is much the same as
in this country, except that instead of Greek
and Latin they have Chinese and Yamato&mdash;old
Japanese. English occupies six hours a
week through the whole five-year course, but
is taught only for reading, so that while most
educated Japanese can understand some English
and have read the classics of our literature,
they may not be able to carry on a conversation
in our language. In girls&#39; high schools
there is a room that might be styled &quot;a laboratory
of manners,&quot; where pupils have a
&quot;course in etiquette, including ceremonial tea
and flower arrangement.&quot; The certificate of
the middle school legally admits a student to
the government colleges, but as there are only
eight of these institutions in the country, they
cannot receive all who apply. Consequently,
students must pass a rigid entrance examination.
There are four Imperial universities, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
which that in Tokyo is the oldest and has about
six thousand students, and several private universities,
one of which, Waseda, has an enrollment
of more than seven thousand.</p>

<p class="indent">It did not escape the notice of the wisest
leaders that perhaps the weakest point in this
new educational system was its lack of moral
training, all religious teaching being forbidden
in government schools. Accordingly, in 1890,
the late Emperor issued the Imperial Rescript
on Education, a printed copy of which with the
Emperor&#39;s autograph is sacredly cherished in
every school, and upon which nearly all modern
Japanese text-books of ethics are based. The
most important part of this document reads as
follows:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye, Our subjects, be filial to your parents,
affectionate to your brothers and sisters; as
husbands and wives be harmonious, as friends
true; bear yourselves in modesty and moderation;
extend your benevolence to all; pursue
learning and cultivate the arts, and thereby
develop intellectual faculties and perfect moral
powers; furthermore, advance public good and
promote common interests; always respect the
Constitution and observe the laws; should
emergency arise, offer yourselves courageously
to the State; and thus guard and maintain the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
prosperity of Our Imperial Throne, coeval with
heaven and earth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I was much interested in two secondary
schools in Tokyo. We had the pleasure of
entertaining the graduating class of young men
from the Normal School. Professor Swift, who
accompanied them, had been teaching in Japan
for twenty-five years, having had the present
Emperor at one time in his school. He said
his students had never been received at the Embassy
before, and in fact, he thought none of
them had ever been in a European house.
There were about forty of the Japanese and
one young Chinaman. I think most of them
were perhaps about twenty years old. They
wore European dress, but the Japanese master
came in his native costume. According to their
rules of politeness, they gathered about the
door, and could scarcely be induced to come in
to shake hands with us. When they finally did
come, they backed into a corner, and in true
Japanese fashion had to be invited three times
before they would enter the tea-room.</p>

<p class="indent">These students go out through Japan to teach
English after they graduate. They did not
speak English, however, quite so well as I had
expected, but no doubt they were a little frightened,
and probably they were more used to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
such questions as I heard at one school when
the teacher read to the class, &quot;Where was
Phineas when the mob gathered about the
portal?&quot; Our guests enjoyed the mechanical
bear and tiger, for, like most people of the
East, the Japanese are especially fond of such
toys. The students seemed to take interest in
the photographs also, and when one asked for
music, we started the Victor and allowed them
to choose their own records.</p>

<p class="indent">Male and female teachers are trained in separate
normal schools, which are government
institutions. All their expenses&mdash;for board,
clothing, tuition and books&mdash;are met by the
State. After a preparatory course of one year,
they take the regular course of four years,
which covers a very full curriculum. Music,
gymnastics, manual training, law and economics
form part of this very modern course of study,
and commerce and agriculture may be added.
English is also included, but made optional.
The necessary training in teaching is given in a
practice school attached to each normal school.
A shorter course of one year is devoted chiefly
to the study of methods and practical work. A
severe military training is given in the schools
for males. Graduates from the regular course
are obliged to serve the State as teachers for
seven years, and those from the shorter course
for two years.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>MISS TSUDA&#39;S SCHOOL, TOKYO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The second school which particularly interested
me was Miss Tsuda&#39;s. Miss Tsuda herself
was one of several Japanese children from
good families who, when they were very young,
were sent to America to be educated. Three
of the girls, it is said, decided at school how
they wished to live their lives. One said that
above all things she should marry for love and
in the Western fashion, and so it was&mdash;she
met a young Japanese studying in America,
and they were married and returned to Japan.
The second one said she wished to be a power,
and she returned home and in Japanese fashion
was married by her parents to a very prominent
leader in political life. Miss Tsuda felt
that she wished to help her countrywomen, and
that she would remain unmarried and devote
her life to education. So, curiously enough,
these three women have carried out the ideals
of their girlhood.</p>

<p class="indent">The school for the higher education of Japanese
girls which Miss Tsuda has established
is practically a post-graduate course, to fit
them for teachers. One class that I visited was
reading really difficult English&mdash;something of
George Eliot&#39;s. Miss Tsuda herself is a graduate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
of Bryn Mawr, and speaks most beautiful
English&mdash;perhaps the most perfect I have
heard from any Japanese. The school is supported
chiefly, I understand, by people in Philadelphia.
I was told that the Bible was taught,
but that the study of it was not compulsory,
and that many of the girls were Buddhists.
These students are from all stations in life.</p>

<p class="indent">The outside of the buildings was in Japanese
style, but the schoolrooms were like those in
America; the pupils sat in chairs and had
desks. I inquired why they did not sit on the
mats, and Miss Tsuda said they had adopted
chairs and desks because the girls felt that on
the whole the chairs were more comfortable,
and that they could move more quickly. It is
thought the race will grow taller if they all
learn to use chairs, instead of sitting on their
legs as they have always done. The majority
of the girls had writing-boxes and books upon
the floors of their own rooms, and kept their
bedding in a cupboard after the custom of their
people, but they were allowed to have chairs if
they asked for them. Hanging upon the <i>shoji</i>
were Christian mottoes, photographs of their
relatives, and in one case a picture of Nogi.
European food is given here, as well as Japanese,
and our methods of cooking are taught.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
These students have modern gymnastic
training every day, and they also play baseball,
which the old-fashioned Japanese think
very unladylike. Every Saturday evening they
play games, have charades, and act little plays,
both in English and Japanese.</p>

<p class="indent">On a previous visit, some years ago, L. had
gone over the Imperial University with Professor
Yoshida. At that time Tokyo University
and the Engineering College had lately been
amalgamated. He said it seemed strange, coming
from an American university, to see the
complete neglect of what we call classics, Latin
and Greek. All the modern sciences, medicine,
the &#39;ologies and law were studied in English,
German and French.</p>

<p class="indent">One department, the seismic, established especially
for the separate study of volcanic disturbances
and earthquakes, was then peculiar
to this university. It is particularly interesting
to the Japanese, for they are constantly
experiencing such disturbances&mdash;the late eruption
in the province of Satsuma is a hint that
results might be still more serious.</p>

<p class="indent">In the art schools in Tokyo, which we visited,
we saw the students painting and carving in
their peculiar, painstaking way.</p>

<p class="indent">An American teacher, who is not herself a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
missionary but has lived with missionaries in
Japan for some time, and whom I consider an
impartial judge, has given me her opinions on
educational matters, including the work of the
mission schools. The Japanese need, she feels,
both moral and commercial instruction of the
kind that only Western teachers can give. This
teaching should be well given by the mission
schools. At first, as in Korea, these schools
were the only sources of Western thought, so
they were frequented by all the Japanese who
wished for any sort of progress. Everything
was gobbled down hungrily. Even if they were
not religiously inclined, they pretended to be,
for this was their only means of learning English.</p>

<p class="indent">At the present time, the government schools
teach Western branches, but they are hampered
by a narrow-minded educational board with
antiquated methods, and tied up by miles of red
tape, so that their teaching of Western studies
is away behind the times. We might consider
the English heard all over Japan a fair sample
of the superficiality that prevails, but, to be
impartial, we must take into account the difficulties
that have to be overcome by students
and teachers. Because of the ideographs and
other peculiarities of their own tongue, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
far more difficult for the Japanese to learn
English than for us to learn French or German.</p>

<p class="indent">Government schools are superior in Japanese
branches&mdash;they teach Japanese and Chinese
classics and ethics, Japanese law and ideals
better than the mission schools&mdash;and certificates
from them give better positions, so ambitious
Japanese go to them, but in Western subjects
they try to do too many things. The
students work only for examinations, not for
really substantial progress. This is noticeable,
except in rare individuals, who would probably
progress under any conditions. The best Japanese
educators realize this as well as the foreigners
and greatly deplore it.</p>

<p class="indent">The reason that some of the mission schools
are not so good as they might be is that they
are too much occupied with proselyting, and
hardly give more than superficial training to
students. It would be better for the Japanese
in the end if more real educators were sent out
rather than so many preachers. If the mission
schools would combine in having Japanese
teachers for Japanese subjects, there could be
concentration of effort and expense.</p>

<p class="indent">There is also a crying need, my friend says,
of schools for foreign children, because there
are no good ones in Japan, and it is expensive to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
send the boys and girls to America or Europe.
An international foreign language school, too,
is much needed. <i>The ignorance of foreign
tongues is one of the greatest barriers to amicable
relations with other countries.</i> The inscrutability
of the Japanese, which we hear so
much about, is due principally to their lack of
familiarity with languages.</p>

<p class="indent">To understand the religious situation in
Japan at all, it is necessary to take another
backward glance over her history. Except during
the two hundred and fifty years of the Tokugawa
Period, the country has always been
open to foreigners and foreign ideas. Chinese
and Koreans, who brought new religions, a new
civilization and a new philosophy, were gladly
received. Young men from Japan sought learning
in other countries, even in distant India.
So, when Francis Xavier and his intrepid Jesuits
made their way thither in the sixteenth century,
they found a cordial welcome awaiting
them.</p>

<p class="indent">For fifty years Christian work went on; hundreds
of thousands of Japanese accepted the
Roman Catholic faith. But the Roman Church
claims to be superior to the State, and the rulers
of Japan saw reason to believe that the priests
were aiming at political power. At once they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
reversed their former policy, branded Christianity
as &quot;<i>Ja-kyo</i>,&quot; the &quot;Evil Way,&quot; and set
about its extermination. Thousands of converts
laid down their lives for the new faith
in the terrible persecution that followed; foreigners
were driven out of Japan, and her own
people were forbidden to leave her shores.</p>

<p class="indent">After the &quot;Long Sleep&quot; of the Tokugawa
Period, the Meiji Era, known as the &quot;Awakening,&quot;
began in 1867. Once more Christianity
was brought in, but this time in the guise of
Protestantism, and again it made rapid progress.
By the middle of the eighties some Japanese
leaders of opinion were even advising
that it should be declared the national religion,
although this was largely for political reasons.
However, full religious liberty was granted in
1889.</p>

<p class="indent">In the early nineties came the reaction. The
conservative element in the nation began to
make itself heard against the mad rush for new
things. Japanese students returning from
abroad brought stories of vice and crime in
Christian lands. The Japanese began to discover,
too, that the standard of Christian ethics
was a higher one than they had ever known, and
demanded a change of life as well as of belief,
and that the diplomacy of so-called Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
countries was often anything but Christian. So
those who had simply &quot;gone with the crowd&quot;
into the Christian ranks fell away. The
churches were sifted.</p>

<p class="indent">This revulsion of feeling was not lasting.
Gradually the Japanese came to modify their
conclusions. Those who remained in the
churches did so from conviction, and a stronger
church was the result. In this period of reaction
Japan simply stopped to take breath, to
adjust itself to the new life upon which it had
entered. Progress now may be slower, but it
is more substantial.</p>

<p class="indent">The missionary question is absorbing, if one
has time to see what has been done and what
is being done now in the schools and kindergartens
and hospitals, although to-day these
Christian teachers are not playing so important
a rôle as they did a few years ago. At first
the Japanese went to the foreigners as their
advisers and teachers, but now that they have
travelled more and know more of Western
ideas they do not need them so much. Six hundred
thousand dollars goes yearly from America
to Japan for missions. Japan is a poor
country, but some people feel it is time for the
rich men there to come forward and contribute
to their own charities, rather than to let foreigners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
do so large a share. I feel that there
is more need of missionaries in China to-day,
especially medical missionaries.</p>

<p class="indent">Fifty years ago there was desperate need of
medical missionaries in Japan. When Dr. Hepburn
opened his dispensary in a Buddhist temple
at Kanagawa, diseased beggars were very
common on the streets, for hospitals were unknown.
Now there are over one thousand public
hospitals managed by Japanese doctors, who
are well fitted for their profession&mdash;some have
been educated in Germany and are very skilful.</p>

<p class="indent">As there are natural hot springs in Japan,
lepers in the early stages of the disease go
there in the hope of being cured, but as a cure
is not possible, they gradually become worse
and cannot leave the country, so one often sees
them begging in the streets. The only beggars
I have ever seen in Japan have been victims
of leprosy.</p>

<p class="indent">Up to 1907 there were no hospitals for lepers
except those founded by foreign missionaries.
In that year the Government established five
of these institutions, but as they are always
crowded, the poor sufferers cannot be received
unless they are very ill. Father Testevinde, a
French Catholic priest, founded the first private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
hospital for lepers&mdash;which is still the
largest&mdash;in 1889. Miss Riddell, an Englishwoman,
has established another, which she is
now trying to enlarge.</p>

<p class="indent">Eye troubles are especially prevalent in
Japan, but the blind earn their living by massage,
and the note of their flute is often heard
in the street. There is a great deal of tuberculosis,
but there are no sanatoriums for consumptives,
who are taken into the regular hospitals.
As the sufferers are kept in their homes
until the last stages, the disease is spreading
rapidly.</p>

<p class="indent">It is very common to see children afflicted
with skin-diseases. Japanese mothers believe
that inborn wickedness comes out in this form.
Since they no longer shave the children&#39;s heads
as in the old days, however, the skin trouble
is disappearing somewhat. Well-organized dispensaries
and district nurses are certainly
much needed in out-of-the-way villages, but no
provision has as yet been made for such work.
Midwives, however, are to be found.</p>

<p class="indent">The Episcopal hospital in Tokyo, where Japanese
women are taught nursing, is supposed
to be the best in the country. Dr. Teusler is
doing excellent work there. The Japanese hospitals
are not so well managed as the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
foreign ones, and the training for women
nurses is not so long or so thorough as in
America. It is difficult for foreigners to judge
their hospitals, because they are intended for
Japanese patients and their whole manner of
living is so different from ours. At first, on
account of native customs, only the poorer class
of women could be induced to take up nursing
as a profession, but to-day the better class are
engaging in it.</p>

<p class="indent">In no branch of medical work has Japan
made greater progress or achieved finer results
than in the Red Cross. In 1877 the <i>Hakuaisha</i>
was formed&mdash;the Society of Universal Love&mdash;which
cared for the wounded in the great civil
war. Japan joined the European Red Cross
League in 1887.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese Red Cross was finely organized
for service during the war with Russia. The
first work was the care of the Russian sailors
at Chemulpo, who were even presented with
artificial limbs by the Empress of Japan. During
the war six thousand sick and wounded
Russian prisoners were cared for by the Japanese.
In return the Russians subscribed to
the Japanese Red Cross. The women nurses
remained at home stations, all relief detachments
at the front consisting of men only, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
on the relief ships there were both sexes. An
American nurse who was in Japan during the
war said we had many things to learn from the
Japanese and few to teach, in the way of handling
the wounded.</p>

<p class="indent">The pamphlet called, &quot;The Red Cross in the
Far East,&quot; states that if a member dies, his
<i>hair</i> or his <i>ashes</i> with the death certificate and
his personal belongings shall be forwarded to
his former quarters.</p>

<p class="indent">The Red Cross in Japan numbers now more
than one million five hundred thousand members,
has twelve hospitals and two hospital
ships, and nearly four thousand doctors,
apothecaries and nurses ready for service.
On her first voyage, the hospital ship <i>Kosai
Maru</i>, was out from March, 1904, until December,
1905, and transported more than thirteen
thousand patients. There are Red Cross stations
also in Formosa and Port Arthur. The
Empress Dowager often attended the meetings
of the society, and assisted with large contributions.
The Japanese Red Cross is said to
be the largest, the best and the richest in the
world.</p>

<p class="indent">To return to distinctively religious work, the
time that I could myself give to the observation
of missions was limited, but I saw something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
of the Episcopal work in Tokyo. Bishop McKim
was absent most of the winter in the Philippines,
but the Rev. Dr. Wallace, whom we
had known in Honolulu years before, conducted
the services. Japanese services were also held
at the cathedral, and a school for native children
was carried on by the mission. The bishop&#39;s
house and that of Dr. Wallace, which were
in the cathedral compound, were of brick and
looked fairly comfortable.</p>

<p class="indent">As the lower classes are decidedly emotional
and are easily influenced by revival meetings,
while the better class naturally tend toward
philosophy and other intellectual studies, there
is room for Christian workers of different denominations.
In actual numbers there are more
of the Episcopalians than of any other Protestant
denomination, as they include the English,
Canadians, Australians and Americans. Next
to these in number are the Presbyterians.
There is a Unitarian mission conducted by the
Rev. Dr. MacCauley, who has been there many
years and whom we knew well. The Baptists
are prominent in Yokohama. The American
Board missionaries&mdash;the Congregationalists&mdash;I
have been told, do the best work.</p>

<p class="indent">A very kindly spirit exists among them all,
but they could economize greatly if they worked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
even more in union. Each mission, for instance,
has its Japanese secretary, because of
the difficulty of the language, but if they combined,
they could do with fewer secretaries, and
could also have Japanese teachers for Japanese
subjects. A few big, broad-minded men&mdash;like
Dr. Greene, who was looked up to by
every one&mdash;who were men of affairs as well
as clergymen, could do much good by acting as
the heads of the missions and directing the Japanese
Christians, somewhat as is done in the
stations of the American Board.</p>

<p class="indent">Right here I wish to pay my tribute to the
beautiful life and the great work of the Rev.
Dr. Greene, whose death last September left
the American Board mission poorer for his
loss. Dr. Greene and his wife went to Japan
in 1869, when the government edict banning
Christianity was still in force. They lived to
see the country under a constitutional government,
with a modern system of education and
full religious liberty. Dr. Greene was a missionary
statesman; he was the intimate friend
of Count Okuma and other Japanese leaders.
As teacher, author, translator of the New Testament,
and president of the Asiatic Society,
he did a varied work. A few months before
his death the Emperor conferred upon Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
Greene the Third Class of the Order of the
Rising Sun, the highest decoration awarded to
civilians residing in Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">A work frequently overlooked is the service
rendered in translation and the compilation of
dictionaries. When Dr. Hepburn, to whom I
have already referred, reached Japan in 1859,
immediately after establishing his dispensary,
he began the preparation of a Japanese-English
dictionary, and as he had previously lived for
several years in China, he was able to make
rapid progress. In 1867 he brought out his
great lexicon, which was published in Shanghai,
because printing from metal type was not then
done in Japan. When an invoice of it arrived
in Yokohama, &quot;Two worlds, as by an isthmus,
seemed to have been united.... As a rapid
feat of intellect and industry, it seemed a <i>tour
de force</i>, a Marathon run.&quot; Later, Dr. Hepburn
assisted in translating the Bible into Japanese.
For all his work&mdash;as physician, lexicographer,
translator of the Bible&mdash;and especially
for his noble character, he was known in
Japan as &quot;<i>Kunshi</i>,&quot; the superior man. Engraved
on his tombstone are the words, &quot;God
bless the Japanese.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The following statistics, given out recently
by the Japanese Bureau of Religion, are interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
as showing the number of adherents to
each of the great faiths:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="believers">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Christians,</td>
<td class="tdr">140,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Buddhists,</td>
<td class="tdr">29,420,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Believing Buddhists,</td>
<td class="tdr">18,910,000</td>

<td class="tdl">Shintoists,</td>
<td class="tdr">19,390,000</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Temples without priests,</td>
<td class="tdr">37,417</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">The discrepancy between the number of &quot;believing
Shintoists&quot; and Shintoists is explained
when we remember that all persons in government
employ&mdash;military and naval officers, officials
in the civil service, and teachers in
government schools&mdash;must be nominal Shintoists,
even though they are Buddhists at
heart.</p>

<p class="indent">I cannot better close this chapter than by
giving the opinions of a few representative
people of different faiths and nationalities
upon the subject of missions in Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Masumi Hino of Doshisha University,
<i>a Christian Japanese</i>, gives reasons
why none of the old faiths will meet the needs
of Japan to-day. He says, &quot;Shinto stands for
polytheism, which in Japan stands side by side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
with skepticism and religious indifference.&quot;
He credits Confucianism with teaching &quot;fair
and square dealings with every man,&quot; but adds,
&quot;It nevertheless fails to meet the people&#39;s
yearning after the eternal values.&quot; Buddhism
will also, he believes, &quot;fail to be the supreme
spiritual force in Japan,&quot; because it does not
attach sufficient importance to ethical teaching;
because it sinks the individual in &quot;the absolute
and the whole;&quot; and because its belief in immortality
is &quot;based on the pessimistic view of
life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Hino acknowledges his own debt
and that of the Japanese people to all three
religions, but questions whether any of these
can meet the pressure of twentieth-century life
and problems. For himself he believes Christianity
alone &quot;is able to meet the demands of
the coming generation in Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. E. J. Harrison, <i>a resident of Japan for
fourteen years</i>, says in his book, &quot;The Fighting
Spirit of Japan&quot;:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I venture the opinion merely for what it
may be worth, but that opinion is, that those
who flatter themselves that the day will ever
dawn when the Japanese as a people will profess
Christianity imagine a vain thing, and are
pursuing a will-o&#39;-the-wisp. They will dabble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
in Christianity as they have dabbled and are
dabbling in numerous other &#39;anities,&#39; &#39;isms,&#39;
and &#39;ologies&#39;; but the sort of Christianity
which will ultimately be evolved in Japan will
have very little in common with its various
prototypes of the Occident.&quot; Most people residing
in Japan for any length of time agree
with Mr. Harrison.</p>

<p class="indent">Then there is the <i>missionary opinion</i>. As
recently as August 22, 1913, Rev. Dr. Greene
wrote from Tokyo:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everything points to an increased appreciation
of the place of religion in human life.
The rapid headway which the more spiritual
philosophy of the West, as represented by
Bergson and Eucken, is making among the
thoughtful men of Japan, including the young
men of the universities, suggests much promise.
Professor Anezaki, head of the department of
Comparative Religion in the Imperial University
of Tokyo, said not long ago that the students
were weary of the materialism still propagated
by certain of the older Japanese thinkers,
and were seeking guidance of younger men
imbued with the more recent philosophical
thought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If the Christian leaders will but put themselves
in harmony with this deep-flowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
stream, they may well indulge the brightest
hopes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At a special gathering of public men in Tokyo
in 1913, when evangelistic preachers from
America were present, Baron Sakatani, the
Mayor, although <i>not a Christian himself</i>, said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You men of the West owe us a lot. Your
civilization has come in and broken down very
largely the old faiths of Japan. We are looking
for a new and better one. You owe it to
us to help us find something to take the place
of that which we have lost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A year or two ago, the Minister of Education,
who is <i>not a Christian</i>, called a conference
of Buddhists, Shintoists and Christians, at
which he said, &quot;What Japan needs is more
vital religion, and I ask each of you to become
more in earnest in bringing your faith to bear
upon the lives of our people.&quot;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Japanese are true story-tellers,
and for centuries their folklore has
been passed down by word of mouth.
The stories which Madame Ozaki, Pasteur
and others have so cleverly translated into
English are a great delight to me, many of them
are so full of humour, pathos and charm. They
fall into three characteristic types:&mdash;stories of
the unreal world, legends of the great warriors
of feudal days, and tales of love. Instead of
trying to describe them I will give an example
of each in condensed form.</p>

<p class="indent">Fairy tales play an important part in the
literature of the people, and, except possibly
the Norwegian, I think none compare with those
of Japan. They have a strange and fascinating
quality which specially distinguishes them
from ours&mdash;they deal with imps and goblins,
with devils, foxes and badgers, with the grotesque
and supernatural, instead of the pretty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
dancing fairies, the good fairies that our children
know.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Travels of the Two Frogs,&quot; from the
charming version in Mr. William Elliot Griffis&#39;
&quot;Fairy Tales of Old Japan,&quot; is given here in
condensed form.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">THE TRAVELS OF TWO FROGS</p>

<p class="indent">Once upon a time there lived two frogs&mdash;one
in a well in Kyoto, the other in a lotus
pond in Osaka, forty miles away. Now in the
Land of the Gods they have a proverb, &quot;The
frog in the well knows not the great ocean,&quot;
and the Kyoto frog had so often heard this
sneer from the maids who came to draw water
with their long bamboo-handled buckets that he
resolved to travel and see the &quot;great ocean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Frog informed the family of his intentions.
Mrs. Frog wept a great deal, but finally
drying her eyes with her paper handkerchief
she declared that she would count the hours on
her fingers until he came back. She tied up a
little lacquered box full of boiled rice and snails
for his journey, wrapped it round with a silk
napkin, and putting his extra clothes in a bundle,
swung it on his back. Tying it over his
neck, he seized his staff and was ready to go.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
&quot;<i>Sayonara!</i>&quot; cried he, as with a tear in his
eye he walked away&mdash;for that is the Japanese
for &quot;good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Sayonara!</i>&quot; croaked Mrs. Frog and the
whole family of young frogs in a chorus.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Frog, being now on land and out of his
well, noticed that men did not leap, but walked
upright on their hind legs, and not wishing to
be eccentric he began walking the same way.</p>

<p class="indent">Now about the same time, an old Osaka frog
had become restless and dissatisfied with life
on the edge of a lotus pond. Close by the side
of his pond was a monastery full of Buddhist
monks who every day studied their sacred rolls
and droned over the books of the sage, to learn
them by heart. Now the monks often came
down to the edge of the pond to look at the pink
and white lotus flowers. One summer day, as
a little frog, hardly out of his tadpole state,
with a fragment of tail still left, sat basking
on a huge round leaf, one monk said to another,
&quot;Of what does that remind you?&quot; &quot;That
the babies of frogs will become but frogs!&quot;
answered one shaven-pate, laughing; &quot;What
think you?&quot; &quot;The white lotus springs out of
the black mud,&quot; said the other solemnly, and
they both walked away.</p>

<p class="indent">The old frog, sitting near-by, overheard them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
and began to philosophize: &quot;Humph! the
babies of frogs will become but frogs, hey?
If the lotus springs from mud, why shouldn&#39;t
a frog become a man? If my pet son should
travel abroad and see the world&mdash;go to Kyoto,
for instance&mdash;why shouldn&#39;t he be as wise as
those shining-headed men, I wonder? I shall
try it, anyhow. I&#39;ll send my son on a journey
to Kyoto&mdash;I&#39;ll cast the lion&#39;s cub into the
valley!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now it so happened that the old frog from
Kyoto and the &quot;lion&#39;s cub&quot; from Osaka
started each from his home at the same time.
Nothing of importance occurred to either of
them until they met on a hill near Hashimoto,
which is half-way between the two cities. Both
were footsore and websore, and very, very
tired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Ohio!</i>&quot; said the lion&#39;s cub to the old frog,
by way of good morning, as he fell on all fours
and bowed his head to the ground three times.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Ohio!</i>&quot; replied the Kyoto frog.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is rather fine weather to-day,&quot; said the
youngster.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it is very fine,&quot; replied the old fellow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am Gamataro, the oldest son of Lord
Bullfrog, Prince of the Lotus Ditch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your lordship must be weary with your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
journey. I am Sir Frog of the Well in Kyoto.
I started out to see the great ocean from Osaka,
but I declare my hips are so dreadfully tired
that I believe I&#39;ll give up my plan and content
myself with a look from this hill, which I have
been told is half-way between the two cities.
While I see Osaka and the sea, you can get a
good look at Kyoto.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Happy thought!&quot; cried the Osaka frog.
Then both reared themselves up on their hind
legs, and stretching up on their toes, body to
body, and neck to neck, propped each other up,
rolled their goggles, and looked steadily, as
they supposed, on the places they each wished
to see.</p>

<p class="indent">Now every one knows that a frog has eyes
mounted in that part of his head which is front
when he is down, and back when he stands up.
Long and steadily they gazed, until at last, their
toes being tired, they fell down on all fours.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I declare!&quot; said the older frog, &quot;Osaka
looks just like Kyoto! As for that great ocean
those stupid maids talked about, I don&#39;t see
any at all, unless they mean that strip of river
which looks for all the world like Yedo. I don&#39;t
believe there is any great ocean!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For my part,&quot; said the other, &quot;I am satisfied
that it&#39;s all folly to go further, for Kyoto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
is as like Osaka as one grain of rice is like
another.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thereupon both congratulated themselves
upon the happy, labour-saving expedient by
which they had spared themselves a long journey.
Then they departed, after exchanging
many compliments, and, dropping once more
into a frog-hop, leaped back in half the time
... the one to his well, the other to his pond.
And so to this day the frog in the well knows
not and believes not in the &quot;great ocean!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Excellent collections of fairy tales have been
made by F. Hadland Davis&mdash;&quot;Myths and
Legends of Japan&quot;&mdash;and R. Gordon Smith&mdash;&quot;Ancient
Tales and Folklore of Japan.&quot; Children
love to read about Princess Blossoming
Brilliantly Like the Flowers on the Trees, and
Princess Long as the Rocks, about Prince Fire
Shine, and Prince Fire Shade, and the other
delightful characters with strange names. The
story of &quot;The Magic Sword, the Glittering
Jewel and the Heavenly Mirror&quot; is perhaps
an especial favourite.</p>

<p class="indent">A good example of the legendary narrative
is that of Hachiro Tametomo the Archer, told
in English by Madame Ozaki in her &quot;Warriors
of Old Japan&quot; and given here much condensed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span></p>

<hr />

<p class="center">HACHIRO TAMETOMO THE ARCHER</p>

<p class="indent">Hachiro was the eighth son of an illustrious
family. As a child he gave promise of being
a very strong man, and as he grew older this
promise was more than fulfilled. He early
showed a love of archery, and his left arm
being four inches longer than his right, there
was no one in the realm who could bend the
bow better or send the arrow farther than he
could. He became the most skilful archer in
all Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">By nature Hachiro was a rough, wild lad
who did not know what fear meant, and he loved
to challenge his brother, Yoshitomo, to fight.
As he grew older he grew wilder still, so that
even his own father found him unmanageable.
One day a learned man came from the palace
of the Emperor to give the boy a lecture. In
the course of his talk he spoke of Kiyomori,
an enemy of the house, as a clever archer. At
this Hachiro laughed aloud in scorn, and told
the learned man that he was both foolish and
ignorant.</p>

<p class="indent">This rudeness was so contrary to the rules
of Japanese courtesy that it made the lecturer
very angry, and when his discourse was finished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
he rebuked the boy sternly for his behaviour.
When the boy&#39;s father heard what had happened
he, too, was angry with his son for daring
to dispute with one who was his elder and
superior, and refused to keep him any longer
beneath his roof, sending him away to the
island of Kyushu.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Hachiro did not mind his banishment
in the least. On the contrary, he felt like a
hound let loose from the leash, and rejoiced in
his liberty. Free to do as he liked at last, his
thirst for conflict became so great that he could
not restrain himself. He challenged the men
in all the neighbouring provinces to match their
strength against his, and in the twenty battles
which followed he was never defeated. He was
like the silkworm eating up the mulberry tree,
for just as the worm devours one leaf after another,
so Hachiro fought and fought, one after
another, the inhabitants of all the provinces
anywhere around, till he had them all under
subjection. By the time he was eighteen the
boy had thus mastered the whole western part
of Japan, and had made himself chief of a large
band of outlaws noted for their reckless bravery.</p>

<p class="indent">This band became so powerful that the Government
decided to interfere and put a stop to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
the outlawry. A regiment of soldiers was sent
against them, but without effect: Hachiro could
not be brought to surrender. As a final resort
the Government, hoping thus to bring the son
to bay, arrested Hachiro&#39;s father, and severely
punished the old man for being the parent of
an incorrigible rebel.</p>

<p class="indent">Although Hachiro was so rude and undisciplined
by nature, there was hidden deep in his
heart a sense of duty to his father, and on this
his enemies had counted. He was greatly distressed
at what had happened, and feeling that
it was inexcusable to let his father suffer for
his own misdoings, he gave up, without the
least hesitation, all the western lands which
had cost him such hard fighting. Then, taking
with him ten men, he went to the capital
and sent in a document signed and sealed in
his own blood, asking the pardon of the Government
for all his former offences and begging
for the release of his father. When those in
authority saw his filial piety, they could not
find it in their hearts to treat him with severity,
so they merely rebuked him for his lawlessness
and set the old man free.</p>

<p class="indent">Soon after this a civil war broke out in the
land, for two brothers of the late Emperor aspired
to sit on the Imperial throne. Hachiro
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
and his father fought on one side, while his
elder brother, Yoshitomo, fought on the other.
Hachiro was not yet twenty years of age, but
was more than seven feet in height. His eyes
were sharp and piercing, like those of a hawk,
and he carried himself with pride and noble
bearing. He was consulted about the tactics
to be used in a great battle, and if his advice
had been followed, the history of Japan might
have been quite different. As it was, the enemy
won the victory.</p>

<p class="indent">On seeing the foe approaching the gate where
he was stationed, Hachiro exclaimed, &quot;You
feeble worms, I&#39;ll surprise you!&quot; and taking
his bow and arrow he shot a <i>samurai</i> through
the breast. The arrow was carried in alarm to
the general. It was made from strong bamboo
and the metal head was like a chisel&mdash;it looked
more like the arrow of a demon than a man,
and the general retired in fear from before the
gate.</p>

<p class="indent">When Yoshitomo came up, however, he was
not afraid, but cried out, &quot;What a wicked
deed you commit to fight against your elder
brother!&quot; To this Hachiro answered, &quot;It is
wrong for me to take up arms against my
brother, truly, but are you not an undutiful son
to take up arms against your father?&quot; The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
elder brother had no words to answer this, and
Hachiro knew that he could kill him as he stood
there. But they were brothers, born of the
same mother, and he felt that he could not do
it. Yet he could not resist raising his bow and
arrow and taking a good aim at the helmet
which Yoshitomo wore, shooting his arrow right
into the middle of the star that topped it.</p>

<p class="indent">In the end Yoshitomo&#39;s forces were so much
greater that Hachiro and his father were taken
prisoners. The older man was put to death,
but Hachiro&#39;s courage aroused sympathy, even
in the hearts of his foes. It seemed a pity to
kill so brave a man, and so they set him free.
But to prevent his using his wonderful skill
against them they cut the sinews in both his
arms, and sent him to the island of Oshima.</p>

<p class="indent">The simple island folk recognized in him a
great man, and he led a happy life among them.
One day, while standing on the beach thinking
of his many past adventures, he was seized with
a desire for more. So, stepping into a boat,
he set out on a voyage of discovery. He came
to an island which was inhabited by people
with dark red faces and shocks of bright red
hair. Landing, he went up to a large pine-tree
and uprooted it with as much ease as if it
were a weed, brandishing it above his head and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
calling aloud, &quot;Come, you demons! Fight if
you will! I am Hachiro Tametomo, the archer
of Japan. If you will be my servants and look
up to me as a master in all things, it is well&mdash;otherwise,
I will beat you all to little pieces!&quot;
He could have done it, too, because his arms
were as strong as ever, notwithstanding the
sinews had been cut. So the inhabitants prostrated
themselves before him, and he took possession
of the island. Later, however, he returned
to Oshima.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the island of Oshima has always been
free from smallpox, and the reason is that Hachiro
lived there. One day a little man, no
bigger than one foot five inches, came floating
in on the waves, sitting on a round straw
mat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who are you?&quot; Hachiro asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am the germ of smallpox,&quot; answered the
pigmy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why have you come here to Oshima?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I come to seize hold of the inhabitants!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You would spread the hateful pestilence&mdash;Silence!
I am Hachiro.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that the smallpox microbe shrank and
shrank until he was the size of a pea, and then
he floated away for ever, as mysteriously as
he had come.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
On hearing of this, the Minister of State decided
that Hachiro was becoming too powerful
and popular a hero. When the young man saw
the soldiers approaching the island, he seized
his bow and, pulling it to the shape of a half-moon,
sent an arrow that upset the boat and
pitched the soldiers into the sea. After thinking
the matter over, however, he decided that
if he fought against the Government it would
bring disaster upon the islanders who loved
him, and it would be better to die at the height
of his glory. So he committed <i>hara-kiri</i> and
thus saved himself from all dishonour and the
people of Oshima from further trouble.</p>

<p class="indent">Of a different sort altogether is the legend
of the &quot;Theft of the Golden Scale,&quot; so charmingly
rendered into English by Mr. Brownell.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">THE THEFT OF THE GOLDEN SCALE</p>

<p class="indent">Daredesuka was a <i>ronin</i> bold, and Eikibo was
a beautiful <i>geisha</i>. One day Daredesuka asked
Eikibo to be his wife, a request that <i>geishas</i>
will generally accept, for it puts them in the
highest of the four classes of society, ranking
almost as well as the nobility. But Eikibo only
laughed and said, &quot;Such promises are like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
little flies that live a day and then no one knows
what has become of them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Daredesuka cried, &quot;It is not so! Give me
some test, for I must have you know I speak
the truth. Shall I bring you pearls from the
deep sea, or golden scales from the dolphins
on Nagoya Castle? Only say the thing, and
I will do it, for you must believe me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Eikibo looked at him and said merrily, &quot;Yes,
I must believe you if you bring me a dolphin&#39;s
golden scale from the ridge of the fifth story
of the tower. I know Nagoya well, for I am
there every year. Yes, I should know you spoke
the truth if you brought the scale!&quot; And she
laughed again, for to the <i>geisha</i> the parents of
a truthful man are not yet born. Then she
added, &quot;<i>Sayonara!</i> My call-time for the Full
Moon Tea-house over the river has arrived. I
beg your honourable pardon, I must go now.
Next month I shall be at the great <i>matsuri</i> at
Nagoya, where I am to dance. Bring me the
scale, and I shall know your heart!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two nights later he was in Nagoya.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Daredesuka was a wonderful man with
kites. He had made large ones when he was
with his old lord, and had once dropped a line
far over a junk that was blowing out to sea,
and so saved many lives. He decided that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
would use a kite to get the scale that Eikibo
had declared would tell if he spoke true. Secretly
he went to work and made a kite so large
that he was sure it would carry the weight of
his body. He found another <i>ronin</i> to help him
in his strange plan, and on a stormy night, in
wind and rain and clouds, he went up with his
kite, and secured a golden scale from the ridge
of the fifth story of the tower. But the tool
he had used in prying it off was wet and slippery,
and it fell from his hands to the ground
far beneath him. The guards&#39; attention was
attracted. At the fatal moment a rift in the
clouds let the moon shine down, and they discovered
the kite. So it happened that when
Daredesuka reached the earth they caught him
with the golden scale. But because he was a
<i>samurai</i> he was allowed to commit <i>hara-kiri</i>,
and performed the act serenely before the State
officials.</p>

<p class="indent">Eikibo did not do the fan dance at the <i>matsuri</i>
in Nagoya, for on the morning of the day on
which she was to appear, an old priest found
her body on Daredesuka&#39;s grave.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">At first it seemed that the opening of the
country to foreigners was to be a death-blow
to the old Japanese forms of art and literature.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
Translations of American and European
books have become very common, and Western
ideas permeate their work. But side by side
with the newer forms, the classic writings are
again coming into vogue.</p>

<p class="indent">Paradoxical as it may sound, much of the
classical Japanese literature is Chinese. This
is especially true of the older works, but it holds
good only in less degree to-day. Chinese has
always been the written language of the students,
and of the higher classes in general,
while Japanese was considered fit only for the
common people, much as English was regarded
down to the time of More&#39;s &quot;Utopia.&quot; But
while written in Chinese characters, much of
this literature is distinctly national in spirit
and feeling, and belongs as much to the country
as does that written in the native tongue.
Only within recent times has the common language
of the people been used for writing books
and scholarly treatises.</p>

<p class="indent">Previous to the introduction of the Chinese
ideographs in the early Christian centuries, the
Japanese had no written language. A knowledge
of these ideographs places all Chinese literature
at the service of the Japanese scholar.
There are over eighty thousand characters, and
three ways of writing as well as of pronouncing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
each, but one finds that most people know only
about five or six thousand.</p>

<p class="indent">The great classical period, corresponding
perhaps to the Elizabethan Era, covers about
five hundred years, from the eighth to the
twelfth centuries. During this time history,
romance, and poetry flourished. The Japanese
record of ancient happenings, dealing with
early history and mythology, dates back to
712 A. D. and is sometimes called the Bible of
Japan. The romances, many of which were
written by women, described the Court life of
the tenth and eleventh centuries. Most of the
verses were written in the short <i>tanka</i> form,
but longer ones, comprising groups of these
stanzas, were common.</p>

<p class="indent">In later times Bakin (1767-1848) became famous
for his novels. One of these&mdash;the &quot;Tale
of Eight Dogs&quot;&mdash;contains no less than one
hundred and six small volumes.</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of the fact that Kozo Ozaki was born
less than fifty years ago, he is regarded as the
Father of Japanese Literature. His work may
be likened to that of making a stone palace from
a prehistoric cave, for he simplified and unified
the language, which was a mixture of the scholarly
speech of the stage with the modern vulgar
tongue. Ozaki was a perfect type of the gentleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
of Old Japan. He was an artist as
well as an author, and also an orator, people
flocking to hear him speak. A group of young
writers was formed in his time, but he was
distinctly the leader. His stories were mostly
of love. Among the seventy volumes published
before his death (at the age of thirty-seven)
&quot;The Confessions of a Lover,&quot; &quot;Three
Wives,&quot; and &quot;The Golden Demon&quot; are especially
well known. Among his most noted contemporaries
were Rohan Koda and Kyoka
Izumi, the latter of whom was termed the Japanese
Maeterlinck.</p>

<p class="indent">To-day Osaki Batsume is one of the most
prominent writers. He was born in Tokyo in
1867, and is said to have taken George Meredith
as his model. One of his best known
works is &quot;Botchan,&quot; which is on the order of
&quot;Tom Brown&#39;s School Days.&quot; Much satire,
and much philosophy, are found in his books,
but he shows little sympathy with the follies
of this life. His local colour and descriptions
of social life are excellent, and he attacks the
imperfections of his day with good effect. He
is considered the master writer of modern
times.</p>

<p class="indent">Many writers and books might be mentioned,
but I want to speak of Dr. Nitobe, whose &quot;Bushido&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
and &quot;Japanese Nation&quot; are known
the world over. His wife is a charming American
woman, and he has been exchange professor
with America. I quote two of his essays
that I especially like.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">HEART AND CONSCIENCE</p>

<p class="indent">In thy sweet tremulous voice whisper in my
ears what thou fain wouldst have. And the
Heart confided her secret of love to Conscience.
Said he in harsh tones of rebuke, &quot;Thou most
foolish one! Thy love is born of flesh. Thou
shalt never behold the face of thy beloved.
Thou art utterly corrupt.&quot; The poor Heart
wept its bitterest; but her sobs stern Conscience
heeded not; they reached the ears of
the angels only.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">THE SOUL&#39;S QUEST OF GOD</p>

<p class="indent">Oft have I asked the question, O God, who
art Thou? Where art Thou? And each time
the answer comes in softest voice, Who art thou
that askest Who I am? What thou art, that
I am, and what I am art thou. And where art
thou that askest where I am? Where thou art,
there am I&mdash;and where I am, there art thou.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
In worshipping God we worship ourselves,
and in worshipping ourselves we worship God.
The real self is within us, the essence of the
Ego is divine. We clothe it in the rags of flesh
and of fleshly desires, until the divine self is
hid; and we call that self which does not
strictly belong to it.</p>

<p class="indent">Japanese poetry differs very largely from
anything with which we are familiar. It has
little if any rhythm, as we understand rhythm.
The <i>tanka</i> was for many years the only form
of verse known. It has five lines and thirty-one
syllables, which are arranged 5-7-5-7-7.
This is an unusual metre to our ears, and translators
are obliged to change the verses somewhat
in order to make them sound more familiar
to English readers. The following poem
by the late Emperor is typical:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">THE NEW YEAR PINE</p>

<span class="i2">Yorodzu yo yobo-o</span><br />
<span class="i2">Noki no matsu kaze!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">Winds calling midst the pines my garden doth adorn;</span><br />

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">By Meiji Tenno.</span><br />
<i>Translated by Mrs. Douglas Adams.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Japanese classical poetry consists of poetical
ideas expressed in flowery language and packed
into the regulation metre. It abounds in word-plays
and all sorts of puns, but is absolutely
free from any trace of vulgarity. In those
early days philosophy, religion, and satire were
not considered fit themes for poetic treatment.</p>

<p class="indent">There is an even more Lilliputian form of
verse than the <i>tanka</i>, called the <i>hokku</i>, which
contains only seventeen syllables, often with
little or no rhyme. An example of this form
given by Lafcadio Hearn is known as &quot;Vagabondage,&quot;
and is a good example of much in
little: &quot;Heavily falls the rain on the hat that
I stole from the scarecrow.&quot; Two others of
quite a different trend are particularly exquisite:
&quot;What I saw as a fallen blossom returning
to the branch&mdash;lo! it was a butterfly.&quot;
&quot;So lovely in its cry&mdash;What were the cuckoo
if it laughed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese believe that if the beauty suggested
in the five lines of a <i>tanka</i> verse cannot
be fully appreciated by the reader, there is
something hopelessly deficient in that reader.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
They do not believe in &quot;smothering the soul
with many words.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps what strikes one most in connection
with the classic verses is the dates at which they
were written, for many that have come down
to us were composed a thousand years ago.
Indeed, Japanese poetry is older than Japanese
history, and tradition says that there were
many versifiers even in the days of the mythological
Emperor, Jimmu Tenno. At any rate,
Japan had a literature of its own long before
the Northmen found America!</p>

<p class="indent">In the old days only nobles, Court officials
and church dignitaries wrote poetry. The
lower classes were not supposed to know anything
about the art. Love and &quot;picture&quot;
poems were popular, and it is wonderful what
perfect thumb-nail sketches were composed. It
has been said that &quot;the predominating feature,
the under-current that runs through them all,
is a touch of pathos. ... It shows out in the
cherry blossoms which are doomed to fall, the
dewdrops scattered by the wind, the mournful
cry of the wild deer on the mountain, the dying
crimson of the fallen maple leaves, the weird
sadness of the cuckoo singing in the moonlight,
and the loneliness of the recluse in the wilds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The souls of children are often pictured as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
playing in a celestial garden with the same
flowers and butterflies they used to play with
while on earth. It is just this subtle element of
the childlike disposition that has helped to discover
the secrets of flowers and birds and trees,
has enabled them to catch their timorous fleeting
shadows and to hold them, as if by magic, in
a picture, on a vase, or in a delicate and wistful
poem.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Do not say anything unkind, but compose
a poem. Is your best-beloved dead? Do not
yield to useless grief, but try to calm your
mind by making a poem. Are you troubled
because you are about to die, leaving so many
things unfinished? Be brave, and write a poem
to death. Whatever misfortune or injustice
disturbs you, put aside your resentment or
your sorrow as soon as possible, and write a
few lines of sober and elegant verse for a moral
exercise.&#39;&quot; Thus Hearn translates from an
ancient writer, and then goes on to say:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the olden days every form of trouble
was encountered with a poem. Bereavement,
separation, disaster, called forth verses in lieu
of plaints. The lady who preferred death to
loss of honour composed a poem before piercing
her throat. The <i>samurai</i> sentenced to die by
his own hand wrote a poem before performing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
<i>hara-kiri</i>. Even in this less romantic era of
Meiji young people resolved upon suicide are
wont to compose some verses before quitting
the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">These three little love-poems, which have
been translated into English by William Porter,

Japan has not been without her women poets.
Lady Horikawa, who wrote this bit of verse,
lived in the twelfth century and was in attendance
on the Dowager Empress Taiken. The

they are everywhere, printed on all useful and

<p class="indent">The two young poets, Horoshi Yosano and
his wife Akiko, are known as the Brownings of
Japan. Yosano was editing a small magazine
of verse not long ago when the poetess Akiko
sent him one of her maiden efforts for publication.
A meeting followed, and in spite of poverty&mdash;for
poets are poor in Japan as elsewhere&mdash;they
fell in love and were presently
married. They went to France, and were made
much of by the young poets of Paris. Yosano
is something of a radical, impatient of poetic
conventions and thoroughly in harmony with
the new spirit of Japan. The power of Akiko&#39;s
work is suggested in a poem of hers called
&quot;The Priest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese drama has not held so high a
place as have the other forms of literature, for
the stage was regarded for many years as nothing
more than a rather common and even vulgar
means of amusement. The classic drama,
represented by the <i>No</i> dances, was partly religious
and had more prestige, but there have
been few good dramatists. The stage is of interest,
however, because it is the only place left
where one may study the manners and customs
of long ago.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">A JAPANESE STAGE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">To give a brief summary of this art&mdash;the
Japanese drama, like the ancient Greek, and the
English also, had its origin in religion. In the
very earliest days there were crude religious
dances and songs. Later, popular tales of history
and legend, mixed with poetry, were dramatized.
Minstrels often recited these to the
accompaniment of the lute. Marionette dances
accompanied by songs were also popular. Since
these performances were regarded as beneath
the consideration of the nobility, the <i>No</i> performance
with a chorus came into existence for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
their benefit. After the earlier form had become
debased and vulgarized the <i>No</i> dances
kept their ancient ceremonial character, and
continued to be performed before Shogun and
<i>samurai</i>, and even before the Imperial family.
They developed into something very like
the classic drama of Greece. The actors were
masked, the plays were held in the open air
with no scenery but with elaborate costumes,
and had a religious quality which they have
retained to the present day. As the <i>No</i> is very
long, comedy pieces were introduced, like the
&quot;interludes&quot; of the pre-Elizabethan stage, to
offset the classical severity. The actors have
always been of a better class than the <i>kabuti</i>,
or players for the common people.</p>

<p class="indent">Takeda Izuma is one of the most celebrated
play writers, having dramatized the story of
the Forty-Seven Ronins, as well as other historic
tales. Chikamatsu is sometimes called the
Shakespeare of Japan; his best work is a play
in which the expulsion of the Dutch from Formosa
is used as a theme. He was a prolific
writer of rather a sensational order. Samba,
who has taken the name of Ikku, is one of the
best dramatists of the present time, and is renowned
throughout Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">Hitherto myths, legends&mdash;religious or secular&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
folklore, as well as passages from
Japanese history, have been the material used
for plays. To-day, however, novels are dramatized
as with us, and many plays are translated.
Western dramas are having a great vogue at
present.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether the plays are original or not, the
author&#39;s name frequently does not appear at
all. When Miss Scidmore, the author of &quot;Jinrikisha
Days,&quot; asked a great tragedian who
wrote the play in which he was appearing, the
star was puzzled and said that he did not understand.
A bystander explained that it was
based on newspaper accounts of various catastrophies,
made into some sort of scenario by
a hack-writer, with the stage-effects planned
by the manager and the dialogue written by
the actors&mdash;each of whom composed his own
lines! No wonder the tragedian was puzzled
by the question. As a rule, however, the dramatic
author has entire charge of the production&mdash;he
writes the play, arranges the scenes,
and consults with the leading actor and proprietor.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AS the traveller&#39;s first idea on reaching
land after a long voyage is to enjoy
himself, I am going to suggest several
forms of amusement. Perhaps
I had better begin by trying to answer what
is sure to be his first question&mdash;&quot;Where is
the best tea-house with the prettiest <i>geisha</i>
girls?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">We found that the most celebrated <i>geishas</i>
were in Kyoto, where the dancing is classic, a
model for the rest of the country. Here were
also the best-trained <i>maikos</i>, or little dancers.
The Ichiriki, or One-Power, Tea-house, which
we visited, is one of the most famous in the
country, for here in the long-ago Oishi, leader
of the Forty-Seven Ronins, resorted in order
to mislead the emissaries sent out to watch him
by pretending dissipation and cowardliness.
There is a shrine in the tea-house to the revered
hero.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
The place is very typical, with its clean-matted
rooms and its tiny garden with miniature
features of rock and water, its lanterns and
stepping-stones, its gnarled trees and clumped
bamboo. At the entrance to this tea-house we
removed our shoes and passed over the soft
mats into the simple, pretty rooms, open to the
air and overlooking the lovely garden.</p>

<p class="indent">It took some time for the little entertainers
to gather, for they are not used to haste. In
the meantime we sat on mats while tea and
<i>saké</i> were served by the <i>naisan</i>, or maids, who
shave off their eyebrows in order to make
themselves plainer and so set off the beauty
of the dancers. They came slipping in and
falling upon their knees before us, bowing low
and presenting the tiny cups for drinking&mdash;all
a matter of much ceremony and etiquette when
politely done.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally some wee <i>maikos</i> came shuffling in
with their quaint dress and hair make-up, their
whitened faces and painted lips, and knelt
among us in picturesque attitudes. These
<i>maikos</i> are girls of from ten to thirteen years
of age who are learning to be <i>geishas</i>. Following
them came the <i>geishas</i> themselves&mdash;the
older dancers&mdash;and then the musicians began
to tune and twang their instruments, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
chant the monotonous songs that tell the stories
of the dancing.</p>

<p class="indent">Our eyes grew big with wonder and delight
as the figures were taken up in turn, one after
another&mdash;movements grotesque, but oh, so
dainty and quaint! Such posturing in adorably
awkward attitudes! Such sliding with
tiny feet turned inward, heads and hands at
all angles, eyes askew! To one to whom their
dancing has become familiar, it is all so fascinating
and fanciful, so full of delight and grace
and meaning!</p>

<p class="indent">Tomiji and Kanoko, both <i>maikos</i>&mdash;dear tiny
figures in gay garments and huge <i>obis</i>&mdash;danced
the Story of the Stone Bridge. One of
them was a peony, and the other was a lion!
Then a <i>geisha</i>, Harikiku, or the Spring Chrysanthemum,
danced the Story of the Spring
Rain, which has a theme like that of Romeo and
Juliet, as old as the hills&mdash;only now one of
the lovers was a nightingale while the other
was a plum.</p>

<p class="indent">So they postured and made picture after picture,
and when it was over, came and sat
among us to help pass the tea and <i>saké</i> and
cake and fruits that had been so daintily prepared.
After that there was more dancing,
and we took our leave amid much laughter and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
many <i>sayonaras</i> and wishes for a speedy return
from our cheery little entertainers.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>geishas</i> of Kyoto dress in more subdued
colors than they do elsewhere. An American
woman would be impressed by the cost of some
of the kimonos, for no expense is spared in
making them as beautiful as possible. The designs
are carefully thought out, and an artist
is selected to execute them. After the work is
completed the stencils are usually destroyed, so
that the pattern may never be duplicated.</p>

<p class="indent">These girls are the professional entertainers
of Japan. They can be called to private houses,
as well as to tea-houses, to help pass the time
with their dancing and singing, and are cultivated
in all the arts and graces that may add
to their ability to please. Thus a <i>geisha</i> not
only sings and dances attractively, but she is
a trained conversationalist as well. She is not
necessarily immoral, as Westerners often imagine.
It is not uncommon even to-day for a
girl to die by her own hand because she loves
a man who, for some reason, cannot marry her.
Many Japanese believe, however, that <i>geishas</i>
are dangerous, designing and hard-hearted
creatures, related to fox-women&mdash;a kind of
goblin-ghost believed in by the ignorant.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>geisha&#39;s</i> songs are usually of love, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
universal theme, and are sung to the notes of
the <i>samisen</i>. They correspond to our classic
love songs, but are much more popular among
the lower classes than any music is with us,
unless it be rag-time! The sentiment and
phrasing are often fairy-like in their delicacy
and charm, but, of course, much of this is lost
in translation. The following is one of the
chief favourites&mdash;it depicts &quot;a lover, when
the landscape is white with snow, going to the
window to look out before he takes his departure.&quot;
His lady-love seeks to delay his
going, and this is the song:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;In vain thy cloak do I hide, Love,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And in vain to thy sleeve do I cling;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Wilt thou no longer abide, Love,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Nor give me for Winter, fond Spring?</span><br />
<span class="i0">I push back the window so slightly,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And point to the snow-burdened land:</span><br />
<span class="i0">O Love, wilt thou leave me thus lightly,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And choose the cold snow for my hand?&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The little quip at the end which turns this
one from a love song to a tribute to the moon
has doubtless teased many an ardent wooer:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;In the wide, wide world</span><br />
<span class="i2">Of woes and tears,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Let us find a narrow spot</span><br />
<span class="i2">To live together,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
<span class="i0">You and I,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Until the world</span><br />
<span class="i0">Is quite forgot,</span><br />
<span class="i2">O my sweet&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Moon that shines</span><br />
<span class="i2">In my little window!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Perhaps the best known tea-house in Tokyo
is the Maple-Leaf Club. We dined there one
evening when there was a fine full moon, and
the lovely, mysterious little garden was like a
dream in the glorious night. The meal was
served on the lacquer service by dainty <i>geishas</i>
as we sat on the soft mats, while delightful
dances were performed before us. Our favourite
was the spider dance, in spite of its name,
but we enjoyed them all, and even the music
of the <i>samisen</i> and <i>koto</i>, which many foreigners
do not care for. This house is famous for its
excellent dancing and its pretty girls.</p>

<p class="indent">One feature of the meal which is characteristic
of a Japanese dinner we could have easily
dispensed with&mdash;that was the live fish, which
was served to us still breathing, with a knife in
its side, to show that it was perfectly fresh.</p>

<p class="indent">Theatre-going in Japan is a source of endless
enjoyment. There is a big and quite beautiful
opera house in Tokyo where the national
plays, both old and new, as well as European
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
opera with Japanese words, are given. Here
the combination of East and West is very interesting.
The audience, although for the most
part wearing Japanese clothes, sits in seats
instead of on mats. It is said that when the
first European opera company came to Tokyo
and the leading lady took her high notes, the
audience was so convulsed with laughter that
the manager had to pull down the curtain.</p>

<p class="indent">The English plays and the light operas given
by the Japanese strike one as amusing. It always
seems strange to see Orientals in European
dress, and one never gets used to their
ballet on account of their queerly shaped legs,
which have been made crooked by ages of sitting
upon them.</p>

<p class="indent">A sample program of a performance given
at the Imperial Theatre in Tokyo, &quot;Daily from
5th January, 1913,&quot; at 4.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, names five
plays: 1. &quot;The Soga Vendetta,&quot; a musical
drama in one act, laid in the twelfth century;
2. &quot;Muneto,&quot; an historical drama in four
scenes, representing Kyoto in the eleventh century;
3. &quot;Maria de Cronville,&quot; a musical pantomime
in four scenes, Paris in the reign of
Louis XIV; 4. &quot;The Woman Hater,&quot; a modern
farce in two acts, the settings representing
the garden of a hotel in Kamakura and a room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
in a &quot;hospital for mental diseases;&quot; and 5.
&quot;The Merry Ferry,&quot; a musical drama in one
scene, representing a ferry landing in Yedo in
the eighteenth century. It would be an exacting
taste which did not find something to satisfy
it in a generous bill like this!</p>

<p class="indent">Most of the theatres are still quite Japanese.
They are built of wood and so flimsily as to
be full of draughts. The stage extends across
one side of the square auditorium, whose sloping
floor is divided into boxes two yards
wide by low railings, which can be used as
bridges by patrons arriving late or departing
early. There is one gallery with boxes in front
and room behind where the lower classes may
stand. The actors enter the stage by means
of two long raised platforms called &quot;flower-paths,&quot;
which extend across the auditorium&mdash;they
receive their name from the custom of
strewing the way of a popular actor with blossoms
when he appears. These paths have been
given up in the Imperial Theatre, as have
also in some cases the little &quot;supers,&quot; dressed
in black in order that they may be considered
invisible, who were of great service in perfecting
the details of a stage-picture. But the old
methods are still used in most of the theatres.</p>

<p class="indent">When an actor wishes to disappear from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
audience he may leave the stage by the flower-paths,
he may vanish into the wings, or&mdash;more
simply still&mdash;he may hold up a small
curtain in front of him and so accomplish the
desired effect.</p>

<p class="indent">The revolving stage is used oftener in Japan
than it is in Europe, to say nothing of America,
where it is practically unknown. It allows
quick changes of scene, for one setting may be
arranged out of sight in the rear of the stage
while another is in use before the audience.
Instead of having the curtains lowered between
the acts, the audience is often allowed to see
the stage turn, which is interesting.</p>

<p class="indent">The plays usually begin at half-past four in
the afternoon and last until eleven in the evening.
A play may run for several days, or
there may be three or four at one performance.
During the intermissions the audience goes out
and gets dinner at one of the score of restaurants
in the building.</p>

<p class="indent">Although stage people are looked up to a
little more than formerly, they are still regarded
as a rather low class. Madame Sada
Yakko is perhaps the best known actress of
the new school, for she met with great success,
not only on the Parisian stage in 1900, but later
in America as well. Danjuro, Kikugoro, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
Sadanji, the greatest actors of the Japanese
stage, are all dead. To-day the best are Sojuro
and Sawamura, who take women&#39;s parts, and
Koshiro Matsumoto, who takes men&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">On a previous visit we spent a day at the
Theatre Nakamuraza, which was then the finest
in Tokyo. Danjuro, who was playing there,
&quot;supported by a strong company, including
the great comedian Tsuruzo,&quot; was the favourite
actor of the time and delighted a large audience.
I do not feel competent to judge his
acting, as I saw him only once, but critics say
that he was much like Henry Irving, and one
of the world&#39;s greatest artists of the old school.
There is a marked difference between good
Japanese acting and the inferior article, the
former is so much more natural, with less that
is grotesque and ranting.</p>

<p class="center">AN ACTOR OF THE PRESENT DAY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The founder of the Japanese drama is supposed
to have been a woman&mdash;O Kuni, a
priestess of the temple at Kitzuki. She was
as beautiful as she was pure, and was skilled
in the dances which are supposed to delight the
gods. One day, however, she fell in love with
a &quot;wave-man&quot;&mdash;a <i>ronin</i>&mdash;and fled with him
to Tokyo. Here her dancing and her beauty
soon made her famous. Not satisfied with this,
she and her lover&mdash;who was also her devoted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
pupil&mdash;became actors, and were the first to
put secular plays on the stage. While still
quite young the &quot;wave-man&quot; died, and O
Kuni left the stage for ever. She cut off her
wonderful long hair and became a Buddhist
nun, spending the rest of her life writing
poems. From her day until recent times
women have not been allowed to appear on
the stage, men taking all the parts as in the
plays of ancient Greece and old England. To-day,
however, women often take part with the
men, as with us.</p>

<p class="indent">The old plays are very interesting and well
done, the costumes being superb and the scenery
excellent. The characters consist for the
most part of <i>samurai</i> and <i>daimyos</i>, two or three
of whom are either killed or commit <i>hara-kiri</i>
during the performance. While their postures
mean little to our eyes, to a Japanese every
movement has its significance. When the actors
pose and stamp around and finally kill
themselves, the audience weeps in sympathy.
The speeches are in the scholarly language,
which only the better educated (very few of
whom are women) can understand. This fact
accounts for the large amount of sensational
action which is considered necessary to hold
the attention of the common people. One result
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
of the many historical dramas given in the
theatres is that the lower classes know and
revere their national heroes.</p>

<p class="indent">In the early days of the theatre masks were
much used. They were made to express sadness,
hatred or amusement, and the actors chose
them to fit the part they had to play. Often
they portrayed the faces of well-known persons,
and these were especially popular. If the actors
wished to represent divinities or devils
they had masks coloured black, red, green, or
gold, often with real hair on them. The custom
of masking on the stage was given up at the
end of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p class="indent">One day we went to a native theatre and sat
cross-legged in a box for over three hours,
watching with real interest the exciting legendary
romance of the famous Forty-Seven Ronins,
whose story is told in another chapter.
This was a very long play which had already
taken twenty days, from eight in the morning
till five in the afternoon, and would require
three days more to finish it. The dialogue was,
of course, quite unintelligible, but the play was
nevertheless very interesting, for there was
always a lot of action. The hero was truly
superb&mdash;by a glance of his eye or a threatened
blow he could knock down a whole stage-full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
of men! There was a very realistic suicide,
with spurting blood and many gurglings. The
acting was a trifle exaggerated&mdash;at times even
grotesque and absurd&mdash;but I could follow the
thread of events quite easily.</p>

<p class="indent">Some clever tumbling and acrobatic feats
were introduced after the play, and a really
funny funny-man, but to me the most amusing
thing was to see an assistant come out on the
stage after some especially violent scene and
proceed to mop the perspiration from the actors&#39;
faces, walking coolly off again when his
errand of mercy was accomplished.</p>

<p class="indent">The costumes and stage-effects were rather
showy. There were no drop-scenes or flies.
The people sat on the floor in their little stalls,
and drank their tea or <i>saké</i> and nibbled their
cakes, coming and going as they wished.</p>

<p class="indent">The monkey theatres, where monkeys take
the parts of men and women, should not be
forgotten. The apes seem to enter into their
rôles with great spirit and energy. They are
dressed in complete costumes to represent
farmers, nobles, or two-sworded <i>samurai</i>, and
they weep and rant and slay each other through
the length of a classic play in the most natural
manner. Their performance of comedy, tragedy,
and drama generally, is absurdly human.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
There are men behind the scenes who tell the
story of the action that is going on, but the
monkeys themselves do everything but speak.
Now and then, however, they forget their cues
and the action stops till they are prompted.
One &quot;high officer,&quot; who came on to the stage
on a big black dog for a horse, caused much
confusion by refusing to dismount and kill his
enemy, because the enemy, being a very well-trained
monkey, insisted upon falling dead
anyhow. These theatres are very small and
can easily be moved about from place to place,
like a Punch and Judy show.</p>

<p class="indent">Once while we were in Tokyo there came to
town &quot;The Royal Australian Circus,&quot; which
gave two performances a day to crowded
houses&mdash;or rather tents. As if the idea of
a circus in the heart of Japan were not a sufficiently
striking contrast, they pitched their
tents, each with its familiar ring and sawdust,
almost within the shadow of an ancient temple.
For a few <i>yen</i> you got a box with red cotton
trimmings and watched &quot;Mr. Merry-man&quot; get
off his jokes in cockney English and Yokohama
mixed. The show itself was poor, both in quality
and quantity, and peanuts&mdash;the fundamental
element of a proper circus&mdash;were
wholly lacking.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
Moving-picture shows are very popular in
Japan as elsewhere. Once, when we were
lunching at the hotel in Yokohama, a very
pretty American woman made up as a Japanese
came into the room, attracting a great
deal of attention. We were quite unable to
make out the situation, but were afterward
told that she belonged to an American moving-picture
company and had just come in from
rehearsal.</p>

<p class="indent">Everywhere the &quot;movie&quot; is taking the place
of the story-teller, who used to hire a room
and tell over and over the tales of love and
adventure which the people enjoy. Only the
more prosperous can afford to see the <i>geishas</i>
dance, but crowds flock to see them on the
screen. They also see their native plays acted
quite as realistically as on the stage, where the
actors might as well be dumb since they do
not speak the common language.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps for the first time the kinematograph
has been of use in making history instead of
simply recording it. When the Crown Prince
of Korea was taken to Japan to receive his
education, rumours were circulated among the
Koreans that he was badly treated and was
in reality a prisoner. There was great danger
of an uprising in his behalf, but the Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
Government hit upon the happy expedient of
having the young man followed through a whole
day&#39;s routine by a man with a moving-picture
camera. When his subjects saw their Prince
looking well and happy, learning his lessons
and playing games with his friends, their fears
were allayed and trouble was averted.</p>

<p class="center">MR. ARNELL AND MR. ARNOLD IN A JAPANESE PLAY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Mr. Arnell and Mr. Arnold, of the Embassy,
took lessons in Japanese acting, and Mr. Arnell
was able to make up extraordinary faces and
to kill himself, apparently in the greatest pain.
Of course he dressed in costume, and with his
<i>tabis</i> on he would make his big toe stand up
in true Japanese style, and would slash with
his sword very realistically. Mr. Arnold, in
one of the plays they learned together, took
the part of a girl named Cherry Blossom; he
did it very well indeed.</p>

<p class="indent">The English and American colonies often
give theatricals: a performance of the &quot;Merchant
of Venice&quot; at the opera house was excellent.
We enjoyed it, and the Japanese students
flocked to see it.</p>

<p class="indent">Sports of various kinds are occasionally indulged
in. The annual fall exhibition, at which
L. was present during one of his earlier visits,
takes place late in October. The sports were
held in the compound of the University grounds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
which was beautifully decorated in honour of
the heir-apparent&mdash;the present Emperor&mdash;then
a good-looking little fellow about ten years
old, who sat on a green baize chair on a raised
platform, surrounded by chamberlains and officers.
There were obstacle races, and the 220
on a turf track was run in 27 seconds, the 440
in 60-1/2 seconds. A race between professors
created great amusement, and a sprint between
champions of the different schools was enthusiastically
followed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The annual fall meeting of the Nippon
Race Club,&quot; wrote L. during his visit in 1889,
&quot;was held the last of October. This is quite a
successful club, and is the racing association
at Yokohama. They have a pretty course out
behind the Bluff, pretty from an æsthetic point
of view only, however, for it is a bad track
with a regular Tottenham Corner near the finish.
The meeting proved to be great fun and
quite exciting. The runners are limited to
China and Hokkaido ponies&mdash;little brutes between
12.1 and 14.1 hands&mdash;and though the
time is slow the finishes are generally close
and exciting. In one race, the Yokohama plate,
one mile and three-quarters, the three leaders
finished within a nose of each other. The great
interest is, of course, in the betting. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
is always a tremendous amount of gambling in
the Orient, and these meetings prove exceptional
opportunities for this spirit to exhibit
itself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The second day&#39;s racing was graced by the
presence of His Imperial Majesty [the late
Emperor] and his suite, and so was the great
day of the meeting, and a great day for Yokohama
also. The Emperor seldom leaves his
palace, but his earthly half&mdash;for he is still
considered half divine by the people&mdash;is fond
of horses and of horse-racing, and he makes
this one of the occasions on which he does exhibit
himself. He was very ceremoniously
treated. After the last race he was driven
around the track in his carriage of State,
surrounded by lancers, for the benefit of
the thousands who had come out to Negishi
Hill to pay their respects to their sovereign.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Near Uyeno Park in Tokyo there is a racecourse,
but it is not so popular as it was a few
years ago, for the Japanese are not horsemen.
The horse of Nippon is thoroughly a beast, and
stubborn, and this fact created variety and interest
when L. visited the riding-school. The
French method was used in those days&mdash;hands
out in front, body bent forward&mdash;and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
retained the old custom of short stirrups and
knees elevated toward the chin.</p>

<p class="indent">The grounds of the school were good. There
were about seventy horses, but L. said that
only a few half-breed ones were passable, for
the thoroughbred Japanese ponies were bull-necked,
mule-hoofed, and had miserable quarters.
Since those days, however, horses from
Australia and Arabia have been introduced,
and although they are said not to thrive very
well in Japan, they have improved the stock
considerably.</p>

<p class="indent">A typical amusement of the country is wrestling.
The professional wrestler is a man of
no mean rank, standing far above merchants,
farmers, and actors in the social scale. His
family has probably been devoted to wrestling
for generations, and he has been trained from
childhood and fed on special food to make him
big and strong. If he is a famous fighter his
patron, who is doubtless some great nobleman,
is very proud of him, and the people of his
province look upon him as little less than a
demi-god.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the ladies all go to bull-fights in
Spain, very few go to wrestling-matches in
Japan. Foreign women are apt to consider it
a brutal sport, somewhat on the order of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
prize-fighting, because the wrestlers are so fat
and dreadful looking. But there is no fist-fighting,
and the skill is so great that I found
it very interesting. You can always tell the
wrestlers when you see them, because they wear
their hair done in old-fashioned style, somewhat
resembling the queue of the matador.</p>

<p class="indent">The history of wrestling goes back to the
first century  <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, for it is an ancient as well
as honourable profession. It began as a Court
function for the entertainment of the nobility.
Political issues of great importance are said
to have been decided in the ring in the early
days. The sport took on a religious aspect
during the first half of the seventeenth century,
when the priests began organizing matches in
the temples to raise money for divers &quot;pious
purposes.&quot; In time many abuses crept in.
There was much bitter feeling between contestants
from different sections of the country,
and so much foul play that the Government
put a stop to all public performances. Not
until 1700 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> were public matches again allowed,
and then only under restrictions which
made it safer for the contestants. From that
day to this, wrestling (<i>sumo</i>) has been very
popular with all classes.</p>

<p class="center">A WRESTLER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">In Osaka we saw some fine matches where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
the wrestlers of the East met those of the West.
People gather from all over the country to witness
these contests, which generally take place
in the middle of the summer.</p>

<p class="indent">There are wonderful matches in Tokyo also,
which continue during the month of February.
Formerly they took place under a large circus-tent,
but now they are held in a huge arena,
shaped something like a bull-ring, only not open
to the sky. The ring in the centre is very small
and raised on a platform beneath a canopy.
A light is thrown on the contestants as they
come swaggering and waddling down the aisles
to meet in the centre, mount the stage, and take
grotesque postures that show to advantage the
muscles of their legs and arms. When they
first come in they wear their gold-embroidered
aprons, which are very costly. Of course these
are taken off when they fight. The referees
sit at the corner under a canopy, while two
wrestlers try to throw each other out of the
ring.</p>

<p class="indent">Each bout is preceded by elaborate formalities.
The wrestlers pray to their gods, and
show themselves off to the spectators. Then
they squat, rub their hands, turning them palm
outward toward the people, take a cup of water,
and scatter salt as a sign of purification. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
done, they take positions on all fours, facing
each other, till, at a psychological moment, they
attack. If one starts his attack before the
other, however, it doesn&#39;t count, and they swagger
back to the sides and rinse their mouths
and scatter more pinches of salt. Between the
bouts much betting goes on.</p>

<p class="indent">Viewed in the dim light, through the smoke
of the many little pipes in the audience, the
scene was stranger than anything else I have
ever witnessed. The wrestlers use such skill,
and the excitement is so great when one of
them has won, that the cheering is as good as
at a football game at home. We saw one bout
where fifteen thousand on-lookers became frenzied
with excitement, because a &quot;number one&quot;
champion was thrown out of the ring. On certain
days the wrestlers appear all dressed up
in their ceremonial clothes and give a dance.</p>

<p class="indent">Ordinary wrestling, or <i>sumo</i>, must not be
confused with the more scientific form known
as <i>judo</i>, or more commonly, <i>jiu-jutsu</i>, which has
been introduced to some extent in our own
country. Here weight and strength count for
little in comparison with skill and adroitness.
While ordinary wrestlers are perfect mountains
of men, some of the cleverest exponents
of <i>jiu-jutsu</i> are quite small. Mr. Harrison, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
his &quot;Fighting Spirit of Japan,&quot; tells an amusing
tale of a contest between exponents of the
two systems, to decide which was the better.
&quot;At the very commencement of the struggle
the big man picked the <i>judo-ka</i> up and, holding
him high above his head, asked triumphantly,
&#39;Now, where are you?&#39; Apparently not a
whit perturbed by this turn of events, the
<i>judo-ka</i> answered, &#39;Oh, this is just where <i>judo</i>
comes in! The moment you attempt to throw
me down, I&#39;ll kick you to death!&#39; Terrified
out of his wits by this awful threat, the fat man,
still holding the <i>judo-ka</i> above his head, rushed
out into the street, shouting loudly for help.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Jiu-jutsu</i> is not practised publicly as is <i>sumo</i>,
for it belongs to the upper classes. The matches
are not advertised or reported in the papers.
Its history goes back to mythological times,
and it ranks with fencing as an art. Hundreds
of young men get up at three o&#39;clock on
winter mornings and practise until seven in
order that they may become proficient in this
difficult exercise.</p>

<p class="indent">The foreigner in Tokyo usually feels that he
has not &quot;done&quot; the city unless he has seen
the sights of the gay quarter&mdash;the Yoshiwara&mdash;which
is very gay indeed and as naughty
as it is gay. There is nothing exactly like it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
outside Japan. It is impossible to see the place
in a jinrikisha, so one must thread the crowded
streets as best he can on foot. Girls in superb
kimonos sit behind barred windows like dolls
displayed for sale in a shop. The condition
of these girls is much better than formerly.
The Salvation Army has done a wonderful
work for them, and not long ago the Government
allowed all who wished to leave the
houses.</p>

<p class="indent">When other entertainment fails, there is
always a <i>matsuri</i>. This is a great holiday institution
among the lower and middle classes&mdash;a
fair held in the streets or in the open spaces
about a temple&mdash;for, like the drama, the <i>matsuri</i>
traces its origin to a religious rite. The
most popular of these fairs is held near the
great Buddhist temple known as Asakusa
Kwannon. The long street leading to this
temple is very gay with the shops on either
side filled with wonderful toys. In various
booths in and about the temple there are many
entertainments in full swing&mdash;tea-houses and
theatres and &quot;movies,&quot; fortune-tellers and
jugglers&mdash;all jumbled up together. It is a
strange mixture of things sacred and secular.
Murray says that even many years ago this
temple was so popular that they had notices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
prohibiting smoking, and warning people not
to take their afternoon naps there.</p>

<p class="indent">Every <i>matsuri</i> has its fortune-teller. I found
one sitting in a little booth&mdash;an aged, bald-headed
old man with horn spectacles which did
not in the least conceal his piercing eyes. He
asked my age, and muttering continually, lifted
the divining-rod to his forehead. After looking
at me through a magnifying-glass he proceeded
to separate the packets of rods and finally, by
means of an interpreter, he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will be married in two years, and have
three children by the time you are thirty!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I bowed gravely and thanked him, telling
him that he was a wonderful soothsayer&mdash;a
verdict with which he seemed to agree perfectly.
It may be mentioned, however, that I
am over thirty, and have been married many
years, with no children.</p>

<p class="indent">Great reliance is placed on fortune-telling
by the Japanese of the lower classes. I have
seen a mother with a sick child shake the curiously
lacquered box of sticks which the priest of
a temple has in his charge, hoping to get help.
She exchanged the numbered stick that fell
out for a slip of paper which had a prescription
printed on it, and then went out to buy
the medicine with a sublime faith that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
was just what her baby needed for its recovery.</p>

<p class="indent">Fortune-telling is not confined to <i>matsuris</i> or
to temples. One hears the calls of the prognosticator
in the streets at night. There is
also a very elaborate system of foretelling the
future, based on the colouring and formation
of the head and features, which a few men of
a higher class practise with quite wonderful
results.</p>

<p class="indent">To these amusements, which any one may
enjoy, I add two other forms of a more serious
nature which are of great interest, although
the foreigner rarely has time or opportunity
to see them during a hurried visit. They are
the <i>No</i> dance and the <i>cha-no-yu</i>, or tea-ceremony.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese nobility rarely attend the public
theatres, but they do attend&mdash;and even take
part in&mdash;the <i>No</i> dances, which are not really
dances, but high-class theatrical performances.
Why a play should be called a dance is hard
to explain, unless one remembers that this is
Japan, where they begin a book at the wrong
end, wipe with wet towels, saw and plane
toward themselves, shoe their horses with
straw, and even have their compass-needles
pointing to the south! The Japanese world is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
&quot;topside down&quot; to us, but I suppose ours is
just as much so to them.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">THE <i>NO</i> DANCE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">We were fortunate enough to see an excellent
<i>No</i> dance which was being performed in a private
house. The performance was given in honour
of an ancestor of theirs, who had died
two hundred years before. It was a very aristocratic
audience&mdash;the upper class people are
easily distinguished, as they are more intelligent
and stronger looking, as well as more refined,
than the middle and lower classes. The
play was given in a very dignified and ceremonious
manner, and the acting was of the
highest order, but to one unacquainted with the
language and the meaning of the various postures
even the best <i>No</i> dance is apt to prove
tedious. The <i>No</i> is further described in the
chapter on literature.</p>

<p class="indent">An even more serious form of entertainment,
and one well worth the attention of those who
have longer to stay in the country and who
wish to make a study of the customs, is the
<i>cha-no-yu</i>, a ceremony which has almost the
force of a religious rite.</p>

<p class="indent">Viscounts Kadenokuji and Kiogoku took us
to one of these tea-ceremonies at a private club
house&mdash;Hosigaoko&mdash;in Sanno. This was the
most wonderful piece of house-building I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
ever seen&mdash;the polish on the floor, the fitting
of the frames, the joining, were simply perfect.
Some of the porch boards were forty-five feet
long and as smooth and polished as glass.</p>

<p class="indent">A very small room of four and a half mats
(nine feet square) is held sacred for the ceremony.
The entrance is made through a door
which is only a couple of feet square&mdash;a custom
remaining from the time when visitors
were so received lest they hold swords hidden
in their robes. The guests, who should be five
in number, sit down in a row, the Japanese
sitting on their feet in ceremonial manner;
foreigners, however, are allowed to cross their
legs, tailor-fashion, for one is expected to remain
without moving during the whole affair.</p>

<p class="indent">This <i>cha-no-yu</i> is a relic of the old days when
ceremonies were invented to pass away the
time, and is the most formal mode of entertainment.
It is taught as a fine art and accomplishment
by various schools, which differ in regard
to small details of etiquette. The master who
performed it for us, Nakamura, is the most
famous teacher in Tokyo.</p>

<p class="indent">The rite consists in making a bowl of tea.
Even the tiniest motion has its own particular
meaning, and is performed most solemnly and
religiously. As in all Japanese ceremonials,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
it is done very slowly, requiring three hours
for its completion. Certain implements are
used for the <i>cha-no-yu</i> alone, and these are of
the finest make. It is part of the performance
to pass them around for the guests to examine,
and it is etiquette to admire them. The tea-making
is followed by a formal dinner, in which
the guests get a chance to air their knowledge
of strict social laws, even as to what to eat,
and how much. The exit is made, after it is
all over, by crawling out through the hole of
a door.</p>

<p class="center">THE HUNTING PARTY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Mr. Arnell of the Embassy went up there in
March, reaching the hunting-grounds six days
after leaving Tokyo. His party consisted, besides
himself, of Major Wigmore, Lieutenant
Keyser, and Mr. J. A. Fenner. They had engaged,
besides a guide apiece, six Ainu men and
three women to meet them at Kushiro and carry
their baggage. The women were found to be
&quot;stunning walkers&quot; and, with others of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
sex, to be not &quot;bad-looking except when tattooed
with a green moustache.&quot; I will give
the story of the hunt in Mr. Arnell&#39;s own
words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Choosing between drenching and freezing,&quot;
he says, referring to the heavy rains in
Tokyo, &quot;I prefer the snow-clad peaks of Hokkaido.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We reached Kushiro, the terminus of the
railroad, three days after our departure from
Tokyo. We were met by our faithful Ainu,
who had consumed gallons of distilled spirits
while waiting for us, and made us lose a day
waiting for him to recover. We finally succeeded
in marshalling three sleighs, each about
the size of a Japanese mat, and seating ourselves
in a squatting posture, started up the
frozen river.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The snow was about a foot deep at Kushiro,
but increased in depth as we approached
the mountains, where it varied from three to
five feet. It took us three days to reach the
hunting-grounds. After we left the river the
road was very uncomfortable. As long as we
kept to the centre, progress was good, but whenever
the sleigh happened to go one foot too far
either side, over we went,&mdash;driver, horse, passengers,
baggage! Spills of this kind were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
frequent, and relieved the monotony of the
journey. We spent two nights at inns in lumber-towns
on the way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We had telegraphed ahead to the last town,
Teshikaga, and a courier was dispatched to
collect the Ainu beaters, who were waiting our
arrival. There we held a council of war with
the warden of the Imperial forests&mdash;the
dwelling-place of His Majesty&#39;s ursine subjects.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We also tried out our snowshoes, oval
frames of mulberry wood, without which locomotion
was impossible. There was not time
to make perfect fits, so we had to make the best
of ready-made ones, all of which were baffled
by the Major&#39;s avoirdupois.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An interesting bird had been shot at this
camp the day before our arrival; it has no
name, but is known as &#39;the bird which appears
only every six years,&#39; and is distinguished by
having its legs above its tail-feathers, so that
when it waddles on dry land, if it ever does
waddle, its tail forms the head of the procession.
It is probably related to the penguin, but
is different from it in that its beak is long and
straight like a crane&#39;s. Strange to say, on our
return to Kushiro by river a week later Mr.
Fenner shot another of the same species, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
with the waters of the Kushiro we christened
the fowl <i>Avis rara Fenneri</i>!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the day after our arrival we continued
our journey by sleigh to the shores of Lake
Kutchare, which is in the heart of an uninhabited
forest and has a circumference of over
twenty-five miles. Here we separated into two
parties&mdash;the Major and Fenner, Keyser and
myself. Across the frozen surface of the lake
rose the ghost-like summit of Mount Shari.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Bears, bears!&#39; whispered the Ainus,
pointing to the peak with their hairy fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After dining on salt salmon, corned beef
and hard-tack, we put on our snowshoes and
set out across the lake, accompanied by the
aborigines carrying our baggage. Keyser and
I, the &#39;lean detachment,&#39; struck for the higher
spurs of the mountain, while the Major and
Fenner, the &#39;fat brigade,&#39; fixed their gaze on
the lower slopes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keyser and I&mdash;hereafter designated simply
as &#39;we&#39;&mdash;reached the foot of the mountain
as night set in, and, to our keen disappointment,
found a dilapidated hut made of pine boughs;
we had yearned to spread our skin-lined sleeping-bags
under the starry heavens. (As it
turned out, however, the roof of the hut was
sufficiently starry, for the night was spent in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
receiving falling lumps of melting snow.)
With the remnants of the walls we built two
fires, one for the wild men, and the other for
ourselves; while I boiled the coffee and the
mush, Keyser fried the bacon and the spuds.
For dessert we had raisins and chocolate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The rest of the evening we spent in council
of war with our braves. With our clothes on,
our guns by our sides, and our Colt six-shooters
in our bags, we resigned ourselves to
dreams of the morrow&#39;s chase, while the Ainus
spread themselves around us like the crust on
a pumpkin pie. The fires soon died out, and
we were awakened about four in the morning
by the murmurs of frozen feet, and passed the
remaining wee small hours struggling between
romantic sentiments and cold&mdash;very cold&mdash;facts.
At half-past five the hairy men relighted
the fires, and at six I jumped from my bag like
a dum-dum from an automatic; I set the mush
and coffee to boiling, and was soon followed by
Keyser with the spuds and bacon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We decided not to wash for three days, for
a bath is inconvenient with all your clothes on,
and the Ainus considered it bad luck anyway.
At seven we put on our snowshoes, and armed
with a can of pork and beans, a biscuit, a flask
of brandy, a kodak, a Winchester high power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
self-loading rifle, and a Colt six-shooter, we set
out with one guide and one packman each.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our course first lay along the shore of the
lake for about a mile, after which we entered
the snow-laden pine forest, where each step
through four feet of snow felt like a ton. After
emerging from the majestic pines, we started
the climb, now erect and now recumbent, until
at last from the middle of the mountainside
the country lay like a conquered army at our
feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Where are the bears?&#39; we asked. The
Ainus pointed to the misty summit above us.
&#39;Whew!&#39; we said, and went on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The bears live in holes which are practically
invisible, among the spurs of the mountain,
and it is no easy matter to approach their
lair. The attack is usually made under conditions
that might easily give Bruin the first
fall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At one o&#39;clock we sat down on the spur
beneath the peak and taking out our lunch we
fletcherized the brandy, and fed the beans to
the Ainus and the dogs. With our stomachs
full, we clicked a charge into the chamber, with
four reserves in the magazines, and scanned
the horizon. &#39;A bear hole!&#39; whined the Ainus&mdash;but
alas, of last year!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
&quot;We reached the summit; the day&#39;s work
was done, but the bears were none the worse
for it, so far. Separating, we commenced the
descent, Keyser down one valley, I down another,
reaching camp about six o&#39;clock. I forgot
to say that one of the Ainus shot a hare,
which provided an entrée for our menu that
evening. The other courses were identical with
those of the previous dinner, which happily
relieved us from the necessity of mimeographing
fresh bills of fare.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At nine o&#39;clock we were tired, but not discouraged,
for our expectations had been fully
realized. We aligned ourselves for the night,
regardless of race or previous condition of
servitude, and were soon oblivious of the crackling
of the snow, for the thermometer continued
to drop until the Hour of the Rat. The men
of the wild snored, but it sounded like the murmuring
of the pines, and only added to the
romance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Next morning we were up again at six,
and, after eating, set out with our previous
equipment, except that we left our revolvers
behind; we had discovered that they impeded
the hip movement, and in the event of a race
would leave us far behind the bear. Fearing
that the animals would be intimidated by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
size of our army, we decided to separate into
two detachments, Keyser with his guide and
packman and I with mine. He climbed one
valley, and I another, with three valleys between
us.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My ascent was even more difficult than that
of the previous day, but I went with a knowledge
of what was before me. I ate two quarts
of snow at each halt, and the anticipation of
the next meal cheered me on. We reached a
broad open slope just below the summit at one
o&#39;clock. The wind cut like a newly honed razor,
but my alcoholic luncheon afforded me all the
comfort of a winter hearth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The dog did not stop as usual to eat my
pork and beans, but trotted up the glassy incline
for a little exercise. In about five minutes
he returned like an arrow from a bow, his tail
seeking refuge between his legs, his voice
pitched in a minor key.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Shut up, you fool!&#39; growled the Ainu,
thinking the pup had been frightened by a
shadow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the yearling only struck another key
and continued his descent, evidently expecting
us to follow. We decided to see whether there
was any cause for his alarm, and followed his
tracks to the side of a tree. The dog watched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
us from a safe distance, growling his disapproval.
Lo and behold!&mdash;there was a circular
hole in the snow, some six inches in diameter.
The edge of the hole was brownish, and no more
evidence was needed that the inmate was there
and had already risen on his hind quarters to
receive us.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It had started to snow in thick flakes.
There were no rocks on which to seek refuge,
and the soft snow fastened us at each step. I
stamped a foothold at a distance of seven feet
from the hole&mdash;the nearer the safer, the Ainus
said, for we could not afford to let the bear
evade us. I was directed to stand sentinel, with
the stock of the thunder-stick against my shoulder,
while the savages, singing in their native
dialect, ran down the slope to fetch a tree.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They were soon back with a trunk about
eight feet long, and took up their position above
the hole. The old Ainu unfastened his girdle
and tied it to one end of the pole, which he
placed in the snow over the aperture. The
guides had only one gun between them, and that
a single-loader, so the young Ainu decided to
go in search of a club in case my shot should
fail to tell and we should be drawn into a fisticuff
with the enemy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No sooner had the hairy youth gone than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
his square-jawed uncle pulled the girdle, driving
the tree into the den just before Bruin&#39;s
nose. Claps of ursine thunder followed. The
beast rose to his feet with a heavy thud. Next
moment the snow scattered as if raised by a
snow-plow, and a broad head with flashing eyes
and bared teeth emerged, and gave me a glance
that ran down my back-bone. He had not got
out beyond the shoulders, however, before I
buried a .401 calibre soft-nose bullet in his left
ear, and close on the tracks of that came a
round lead ball from the savage&#39;s blunderbuss.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My Winchester makes a deep impression
on animal tissue at a distance of one hundred
yards, deep enough to make a bear forget that
he is alive, so the impact at a range of seven
feet was tremendous. When the bullet struck
the head it swung to the opposite side, as if
hit by a fifty-pound sledge-hammer. There
was a pause of fifteen seconds, and the huge
form made another plunge, which was evidently
the death struggle, but giving the advantage
to the doubt I pulled the trigger again;
there was no response, and I found that a bamboo
leaf had choked the bolt. In about five
seconds, however, I was able to restore the gun
to working order by ejecting the cartridge in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
the chamber, and then popped two more peas
into the waning intellect of the brute. The
Ainu&#39;s lead must have gained admission, as he
stood a foot nearer than I did, but we failed
to locate it at the autopsy. My bullet&mdash;a pancake
of lead with splinters of nickel-steel&mdash;was
lodged in the right jaw, having passed
through the brain from the left ear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The next step was to skin and quarter the
bear, but before doing so my Ainus insisted
on paying their last respects to the spirit of
the departed&mdash;a spirit which was to hover
over them for all time to come, for the moment
my bullet entered the ear of the bear he had
taken his place in the pantheon of Ainu gods.
The savages spread his feet and placed his head
in position, then they arranged several branches
in a row before him, and kneeling on the snow,
with bowed heads, they rubbed their hands and
muttered fervent prayers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They prayed, &#39;O bear, we thank thee for
having died! We humbly beseech thee to permit
us to kill another bear as we have killed
thee. We pray that this happy event may not
be far off, and that when we meet thy brother
or sister, thy aunt or uncle, or other kin, whatever
his or her kinship may be, thy kin may
not bite or strike us, and above all, dear bear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
that he or she may not evade our poisoned
arrow or our leaden bullet. O bear, we beseech
thee to be always near, and to oversee
our welfare in this land, where since the advent
of the Japanese the number of bears is rapidly
decreasing, so that we poor Ainus are day by
day being deprived of the pleasure of our
forefathers. O bear, again we thank thee for
having died!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After the prayer meeting had closed the
young Ainu crawled into the wintry home of
the deceased. But the cub which we expected
to take back to Tokyo was not to be found.
However, on skinning the bear we did find two
lead bullets which told the story&mdash;the cub had
been killed the previous year, but the mother
had escaped. It seems cruel to have taken her
life, but when one knows that she had killed at
least ten horses during her career, and would
have continued to slaughter two per annum for
the rest of her days had she been allowed to
live, she forfeits the sympathy of the wise.
The forests of Hokkaido are strewed with the
bleached bones of horses taken from the pastures
by marauding bears. Wherever we made
our headquarters we were visited by owners of
pastures, who were often accompanied by the
Chief of Police or the provincial Governor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
earnestly requesting us to come to their assistance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Having justified my act, I shall resume the
story. The first part which the Ainus dissected
was the stomach, which is dried and powdered
and serves as a panacea for all ills; this was
the occasion for a short prayer and was sanctified
by repeated touching of the bear&#39;s nose.
After the skin had been removed, the meat was
cut into six portions and was buried in the snow
until next morning. The skin itself was rolled
into a scroll weighing about sixty pounds, and
was placed on the back of the young Ainu. The
head of the bear faced outward, and the packman
looked like one of the itinerant showmen
who used to ply their trade along the Tokaido
in the days of the Shogun, with the mask of a
long-nosed hobgoblin fastened to his back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We descended the mountain as if shod with
skees and were soon crossing the lake on our
way to camp. When the <i>menoko</i>&mdash;female
children, a generic term for Ainu women&mdash;spied
us at a distance of half a mile they burst
into a weird chant, clapping their hands and
jumping up and down, keeping it up until we
reached the place where they stood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keyser had already returned with an
empty bag. The Major and Mr. Fenner joined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
us that evening, having deserted their camp
after vain efforts to traverse the soft snow
which covered the lower hunting-grounds, on
which they had worked; later their <i>menoko</i> followed
with their baggage. The evening around
the campfire was very merry as we ate our bear
meat and watched the Ainus perform their
devotions.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">MR. ARNELL AND AINUS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;The ground had been cleared to make a
space for the altar. On this the bearskin was
placed with the head pointing outward. Each
Ainu knelt before the head, and as he rubbed
his hands&mdash;now and again raising them to his
forehead, after lightly touching the nose of the
bear&mdash;he murmured a prayer similar to the
one made on the mountain. One grey-bearded
patriarch continued his fervent invocation more
than five minutes, then, having finished, he
knelt in front of me, and after a solemn salaam
exclaimed, &#39;Hurrah, hurrah!&#39; With this the
introductory service came to an end.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Meanwhile the barbarians had been boiling
their bear meat and, the services over, they
started to make way with it, their eating continually
interspersed with rubbing of hands
and mumbling of prayers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Next day Keyser and Fenner went out
again in search of bear, but I decided to rest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
on my oars for one day, and so did the Major,
who had become completely disgusted with the
snow. We spent the day in talking and eating,&mdash;three
meals on bacon and two on bear. All
the comfort and luxury of a cozy home seemed
to be concentrated between our mud floor and
snow roof. At noon four carriers, who had
gone up the mountain early in the morning,
returned with their loads of meat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the evening, after every one had assembled
in camp and Keyser and Fenner had
reported that no tracks of bear had been seen,
preparations for the grand mass were begun.
The Ainu to whom the hunting-grounds of the
mountain belonged removed the hide and meat
from the skull. Ordinarily he would have left
the nose, but as I wished it for purposes of
mounting he reluctantly consented to cut it off.
The skull cleaned, it was placed on the altar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The ceremony then opened and continued
for over an hour, every Ainu present taking
part. While the mumbling of prayers, rubbing
and raising of hands, and occasional touching
of the missing nose, were going on, the cartilaginous
soles of the bear&#39;s feet had been boiling,
to the accompaniment of intermittent
chanting by the women, and after being cut into
two-inch pieces were arranged on sticks in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
front of the skull. After another invocation
the elastic tid-bits were removed and eaten
with much loud smacking. The meat was put
through a similar ordeal, and the services were
followed by a grand feast, which lasted till
after midnight and was characterized by a
great deal of mirth, despite the absence of distilled
spirits, which the Chief of Police had
prohibited. To us its absence was a blessing,
but to the simple barbarians a curse, for they
imbibe spirits as we drink water&mdash;in fact, it
is the principal cause of the gradual extermination
of the race.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We went to bed before the dark-skinned
Mohawks, but got up with them at sunrise.
During the night sleet had begun to fall, and
as we could not tell how long it might continue,
we decided to break camp and re-cross the lake,
as soon as we had seen the funeral services.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The place chosen for the last rites was the
top of a snow-covered knoll beside the camp,
where a palisade was built of bamboos and fir
branches, decorated with the ceremonial sticks
with the skull of the bear in the centre. The
men&mdash;for apparently the Ainu women do not
take part in funerals&mdash;then proceeded to the
place in a line, and arranging themselves before
the palisade, invoked the spirit of the king of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
the forests in loud prayers, to the accompaniment
of the usual rubbing and raising of hands.
We were clicking our cameras meantime, which
added a musical touch to the solemnity of the
occasion, but the snow showed no traces of our
tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ordinarily the skull is left on the palisade
for years and years, but I needed it to mount
the head of my trophy, so I negotiated with my
guide for its surrender. He readily consented,
but when the women learned my intention they
made a terrible fuss, and with tears in their
eyes begged me to leave their god undisturbed.
I was finally allowed to take the skull, if I
promised to see that it was not abused on the
way to Tokyo, and if, after my return, I would
have it placed on the altar of my parlour, paying
it due reverence for all time to come. The
parting between the women and the skull was
quite pathetic, and would have moved a softhearted
man to mingled emotions. I have fulfilled
my promise, and the mounted skull now
adorns the dais of my drawing-room, with its
nose pointed toward all believers in the omnipotence
of the bear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The services over, we shouldered our
lighter baggage and started on our snowshoes
across the lake, followed by the packmen. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
ice had begun to melt in places, as the lake is
full of hot-water springs, so we had to select
our route with care. The women and the bearskin
were left behind, as there was some sort
of a memorial service still to be held, for which
our packmen returned that evening. It was
to have been a primitive bacchanalia, but as
the Chief of Police had ordered the only two
human habitations within miles not to sell any
<i>saké</i> or <i>shoohu</i> to the worshippers, they must
have passed a merry night on icewater.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After crossing the lake we walked about
five miles farther to a hot sulphur spring,
where we were given a fairly comfortable room
by the Japanese landlord. The hot springs
were excellent, and we took three baths each,
one for every day we had hunted. We woke
bright and early to find the sleighs waiting to
take us back to civilization, and contrary to our
expectations, the Ainus appeared at the appointed
hour with the skin. Paying them off,
we bade them farewell until the scarcity of bear
meat in Tokyo should necessitate our return.
As parting gifts we distributed among them
most of our remaining cans of corned beef,
Boston baked beans, sweet corn and strawberry
jam. From the manner in which the bear meat
was treated by the recipients in the Capital, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
fear we shall have to find some other pretext
than its scarcity for revisiting the sylvan wilds
of The Highway of the Northern Seas&mdash;Hokkaido.
They said it tasted granular, and fed it
to the dogs, cats and chickens!&quot;</p>

<p class="h3">MOTORING AND CRUISING</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illo_393.jpg" width="100" height="118" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PARTIES of tourists usually land at
Yokohama, rejoining their steamer a
few days later at Kobe. After a little
sight-seeing in Yokohama they generally
take a train to Kamakura and stop at the
island of Enoshima. If there is time, they continue
on to Miyanoshita. They take in Tokyo,
Nikko, and Kyoto, with perhaps a few hours in
each, and then go on to Kobe. In the limited
time this all has to be done by train, which, in
the present condition of the roads, is a quicker
and surer method of travel than any other.
<i>Kurumas</i> (jinrikishas) can be used for side
trips, or <i>kagos</i> (sedan-chairs) for mountain
climbs. Trolley cars are a convenience in the
cities, and often take one to quite remote
places in the country as well. The rates are
lower than in the West, and special cars can
be hired for a moderate amount.</p>

<p class="center"><i>KAGOS</i> (SEDAN-CHAIRS) FOR MOUNTAIN CLIMBS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">For those who have longer to stay, the motor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
offers a delightful way of seeing the country
as well as many opportunities for getting off
the beaten track and having adventures. Because
the roads are narrow and the bridges
frail, the motorcycle, rather than the automobile,
is after all the ideal method of travel, for
it takes one into really out-of-the-way places
which could not be reached in a larger machine.
Of course this pastime is only for men, and for
men who are willing to rough it, at that. If
a woman is at all inclined to be nervous she
had better not try motoring in Japan, even in
a car, except on well-known roads.</p>

<p class="indent">The traveller with sufficient time at his disposal
also finds various trips to be made by
steamer, such as the one through the Inland
Sea, which is described in this chapter.</p>

<p class="indent">Motoring is just beginning to be popular in
Japan. Many of the roads are not bad except
in spots, and the scenery is usually beautiful.
During the rainy season the country roads are
very disagreeable,&mdash;often almost, if not quite,
impassable. Only in a city like Tokyo or Yokohama
is it worth while for the resident to have
a car the year round.</p>

<p class="indent">The best touring months are in the spring
and autumn&mdash;in March, when the plum blossoms
are finishing and the cherry blossoms beginning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
and in April and May. In June comes
the rain. The heat during July and August is
very severe, then come the typhoons, and rain
again in September. When the maple leaves
are turning, later in the autumn, there is another
happy moment for the motorist. Although
the winters are not really disagreeable,
there is a cold wind, and the Japanese inns are
damp and chilly.</p>

<p class="indent">A short machine is necessary, as well as a
skilful chauffeur, for the turns are often very
sharp, especially at the bridges. These bridges,
by the way, are treacherous and need to be
strengthened for motor-traffic. They were
built for the use of a &#39;ricksha or&mdash;at the most&mdash;for
a horse and two-wheeled wagon. Gasoline
may now be procured in many places, and
road-maps are also to be had. It is important
to take some one along who can speak Japanese,
and to provide food for the trip, if one does not
like the native dishes. Hot tea may be had
almost anywhere.</p>

<p class="indent">In taking a motor trip one would naturally
start at Yokohama. At first glance this city
seems thoroughly Japanese, but, on knowing it
better, I have found it to be in reality very
European and not at all typical of the country
or its people. It is rather a laughing-stock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
among the Japanese themselves, who call things
&quot;Yokohama&quot; as a term of derision. Most
foreigners live on the &quot;Bluff,&quot; which overlooks
the bay. Some of the houses in this section
are fascinating, for they are surrounded
by gardens and command wonderful views.
Some glimpses of real Japan may be caught
in the native quarter of the city, but coming
back to Yokohama after having been into the
interior gives one the impression of having
left Japan behind.</p>

<p class="indent">A trip which is easy and comfortable for
ladies may be made from Yokohama to Miyanoshita.
It takes several hours each way, with
a day added if one goes on over the Hakone
Pass. L. and I took this trip while the plum-trees
were in bloom.</p>

<p class="indent">From Yokohama to Kamakura much of the
way was through the paddy-fields, which reminded
me of trips on the narrow roads between
the canals of Holland. We passed some
strange new pagodas on a hillside, erected
lately in honour of the Fire-God&mdash;a terrible
creature carved on a rocky cliff and painted in
colours. We also passed a succession of little
places famous for the &quot;plum-viewing,&quot; with
their small tea-houses all ready for the viewers.
There were camellia-trees in bloom, too,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
and the paddy-fields were beginning to show
faint greens where the farmers were pottering
about in the carefully cultivated land.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 449px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">THE BUDDHA OF KAMAKURA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Kamakura is sunny and warm, by the sparkling
sea. Many invalids go there, especially
in winter&mdash;foreigners often rent the native
houses. The big Buddha, surrounded by plum-trees,
has twice been washed by tidal waves.
The silvery branches with their white blossoms
looked as if they had been sprinkled with snow,
and the delicate perfume in the air was delicious.
The Buddha is said to have stood there
in the wind and rain and sunshine for seven
hundred years. It is perhaps the finest large
piece of bronze in the world; it has eyes of
pure gold and a great silver boss on its forehead
that looks like a full moon, while on
its head are eight hundred curls. &quot;These
are the snails that kindly coiled themselves
on Buddha&#39;s head when by thinking too
much in the hot sun he might have been sun-struck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">We visited another shrine at Kamakura,
where there is a huge trunk of cedar carved
into a Kwannon&mdash;she is the goddess of pity
and humility. It is said that once upon a time
an illumination was seen over the waters, and
on going to find out what caused it some fishermen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
discovered the figure of this goddess,
carved in wood, which they brought ashore and
set up for all to worship.</p>

<p class="indent">It is told of Kwannon that &quot;in her boundless
love she divided herself into many bodies and
renounced the joy of Nirvana that she might
bring peace and happiness to others.&quot; She is
often compared to the Christian Madonna, and
is considered the goddess of mercy, as well as
the protector of dumb animals, especially of
horses and others that work for man. She is
variously depicted in Japanese art&mdash;sometimes
with a thousand hands, in each of
which is an answer to a prayer&mdash;sometimes
with eleven faces, &quot;smiling with eternal
youth and infinite tenderness.&quot; A remarkable
piece of embroidery which was brought to the
Embassy to sell at a huge price showed Kwannon
as the divine mother, pouring forth from
a crystal vial holy water, each bubble of which
contained a tiny child.</p>

<p class="indent">Osame told me that Kwannon was the daughter
of a king of the Chow dynasty who sentenced
her to death for refusing to marry. The
executioner&#39;s sword broke without inflicting a
wound, but her spirit went to hell, which, however,
she straightway turned into a paradise.
The king of the infernal regions hurried her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
back to earth and turned her into a lotus flower
on the island of Pooh-to.</p>

<p class="indent">While we were standing at her shrine, which
is on the side of a pine-clad hill looking out
over the sea, there came a sad funeral procession
led by men carrying a big wicker birdcage.
When I asked about it, Osame said that
birds were kept in it and were set free at
funerals to typify the release of the soul.
There was the usual gold paper, and the coloured
paper lotus flowers. The unpainted
carved box, or coffin, shaped something like a
palanquin, was borne on the shoulders of four
men. The widow was clad in white, which is
the mourning colour. Following the mourners
came men, bringing trees and plants to set out
on the grave.</p>

<p class="indent">En route from Kamakura to Miyanoshita we
motored over the old Tokaido road&mdash;the great
highway from Tokyo to Kyoto&mdash;with its
crooked pines on every side and its views of the
bright blue sea and of enchanting Fuji, so often
represented in Japanese art.</p>

<p class="indent">On the way we passed the wonderful island
of Enoshima. Here Benten, goddess of the sea,
has her shrine, for the island is said to have
arisen from the deep at her coming. She is one
of the seven goddesses of luck, and is likewise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
referred to as the divinity of love, beauty and
eloquence. It is customary for people who are
in love, or for those who, on the contrary, wish
to be divorced, to go to Enoshima and pray to
Benten. She is said to have descended from
the clouds and, entering a cavern where the
sea king dwelt, to have married him out of hand.
He was a dragon who devoured little children,
but her good influence put an end to his sins.
She is depicted as having eight arms, and as
riding upon a dragon. Her shrines are generally
found on islands.</p>

<p class="indent">I had always felt that Fuji was much overrated,
but on this day it certainly wove its
charm about me. Mayon, in the Philippines,
is as beautiful in shape, but it never has any
snow on its summit. Our own snow-capped
Mt. Rainier is truly superb, but its shape is less
symmetrical than Fuji&#39;s. Snow-capped and
perfect in line, Fuji seemed to rise out of the
sea in its mist, a great, beautiful ghost-mountain.
Seeing it, I felt the Spell of Japan as
never before.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><i>Fuji from Otome-Toge</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">So many things have been said about Fuji,
and so many poems have been written, that it
would be impossible for me to invent anything
new in regard to it. It is called the &quot;Supreme
Altar of the Sun&quot; and the &quot;Never-dying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
Mountain.&#39;&#39; It is supposed to hold the secret
of perpetual life, and miracles are said to have
been performed there. It is likened to a white
lotus, and to a huge inverted fan. Sengen, the
fire goddess, and Oanamochi, &quot;Possessor of
the Great Hole,&quot; dwell there, while near the
shrine of the God of Long Breath is a spring
of healing for the sick.</p>

<p class="indent">Miyanoshita is one of the most famous summer
resorts in Japan. It is two thousand feet
above the sea, and is surrounded by mountains
as high again. The climb up there in the motor
went well; the air was fine and clear, and the
hot sulphur baths at the hotel refreshed us.
This hotel is excellent. It overlooks a beautiful
valley, picturesque and green in the foreground,
and shading off into that pale blue of
distance which makes a Japanese panorama so
complete. Around us rose high hills, ravined
and grotesque, with here and there the roofs
of tiny tea-houses peeping through the trees.
As I looked from my window the tops of the
mountain opposite were all big and grey, like
elephants&#39; ears. The view down the valley to
the sea made me think of the wonderful Benquet
Road in the Philippines.</p>

<p class="indent">In a tea-house garden near the hotel were
many-coloured carp dashing about in the clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
sulphur water. The long-tailed cock of antiquity
is now rarely to be found, but there was
one in this same garden, and also a minor bird
which spoke quite as clearly as our parrot at
home.</p>

<p class="indent">We went over the pass to Hakone. The road
was difficult; the bridges were often shaky, and
occasional small landslides delayed our progress.
We were rewarded, however, by the
sight of a charming lake some seven miles in
length, with mountains stretching down into it,
and Fuji-San beyond, hiding his lovely head in
the clouds. The Emperor has a summer palace
at Hakone, built in European style.</p>

<p class="indent">When we came down from Miyanoshita in
the motor, it was a beautiful morning, and a
beautiful ride it was, too, down through the
valleys and out on to the plain, along the Tokaido
with its avenues of cryptomerias, and
across the paddy-fields.</p>

<p class="indent">I am told it will soon be possible to go by
motor from Yokohama to Miyanoshita by another
route&mdash;over the new military road when
it is finished, across by Otome-Toge, and over
the Hakone Range into the valley this side of
Fujiyama to Gotimba.</p>

<p class="indent">Another trip from Yokohama is to Mishima.
We did not try this ourselves, but the account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
of it given by a writer in the <i>Japan Magazine</i>,
from whom I quote, shows some of the difficulties
to be encountered on the road:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was on the stroke of ten, on the nineteenth
of April, when three of us, with a chauffeur,
pulled out of the E. M. F. garage on the
Yokohama Bund in the new twenty-five h. p.
Studebaker. Kozu was reached at noon, and
twenty minutes later we turned off the beaten
track&mdash;from a motoring point of view&mdash;at
the terminus of the Odawara-Atami light railway.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here the real interest of the day&#39;s run
began. The road to Atami, though rather narrow,
has a good surface for the most part, and
runs along the coast, now almost at the sea
level, now winding over the hills, from which
a magnificent panoramic view of the Odawara
Bay far below is obtained. From the heights
the coast with its white line of surf can be followed
by the eye beyond Enoshima on the one
side, and on the other side a succession of capes,
merging in the haze, end in the dim vista of
Vries Island. A halt of some thirty minutes at
a roadside rest-house near Manazuru to have
lunch and enjoy the beautiful scenery passed
all too quickly. Atami was reached at 2.30 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So far the road presents no particular difficulties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
but good care must be taken, and a
little backing is required to get around two or
three sharp turns. After a short halt to inspect
the radiator and to see whether the tires
were well inflated, we started on the long
climb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The motorist had gone over the road on foot,
and it had seemed quite possible to negotiate
all the curves without backing, but this did not
prove true in actual test. The curves were for
the most part of the real hairpin variety and
came in such never-ending series that count of
them was soon lost. On more than half of them
it was necessary to back at least once, before
getting round.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless,&quot; he resumes, &quot;we were making
good and steady progress until within
about a mile and a half from the top of the
ridge, when the gasoline began to get too low
to reach the engine against the incline and the
cant of the car on the turns. From this spot
on, the last mile resolved itself into a trial of
patience and muscle in man&oelig;uvring the car
round each corner to a sufficiently even&mdash;or
uneven&mdash;keel for the gasoline to run to the
engine until the critical point of each turn was
surmounted. The last two corners were negotiated
in the dark, with the writer sitting on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
gasoline tank and the chauffeur blowing into
it to force the gasoline into the carburetor. At
eight in the evening we arrived safely at
Mishima.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Taking the above experience as a basis, it
can be safely asserted that passengers on a
motor car would not run any risk at all on this
road, as there are no unprotected banks over
which they could fall, as on the Miyanoshita
road. It also makes one of the most beautiful
trips out of Yokohama, for as one gradually
rises above Atami the magnificent panorama of
land and sea displays itself before one&#39;s eyes
in ever widening circles. In our case we
reached the Daiba Pass too late to enjoy the
splendid view of the hills on the one side, and
of the ocean with a fringe of foam along the
shore down below, though the breakers could
be distinctly heard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">We often motored from Yokohama to Tokyo.
The road-bed is comparatively good, being
hard and smooth, but it is very narrow, with
constant traffic, and there are so many children
running across that speed is impossible. Although
the distance between the two cities is
about twenty miles, the street is like one long
village with its rows of houses on either side.
It was endlessly interesting, with its procession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
of carts and wagons with their picturesque
loads, and its groups of little, scurrying children
in many-coloured kimonos clacking about
on their clogs. There were continuous rows of
small open shop-fronts with their wares set out
in pretty array, and we had hurried glimpses of
clean matted interiors and quaint gardens and
temple entrances. Every now and then we
would cross one of the queer, humped-up little
bridges and look down upon the thatch-roofed
cabins and high poops of the sampans congested
in the river beneath. About an hour
and a half is allowed for the run.</p>

<p class="indent">Once on this road we stopped at Osame&#39;s
home&mdash;a perfect plaything of a house about
two inches big, with an artistic bamboo fence
and wicket, a tiny entrance-place, and little six-mat
rooms. The wife prostrated herself repeatedly,
and offered us tea and cake with
many protestations which Osame translated.
Their baby was brought in, and looked wisely
at some presents which we had for him.</p>

<p class="indent">There are a number of one-day excursions
from Tokyo for cars, and still more one- and
two-day trips for motorcycles. The roads
about Tokyo are good, but with a car one is
likely to strike mires or bad bridges or ferryboats
that are too small. These difficulties can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
generally be overcome, however, and they make
the trip both varied and amusing.</p>

<p class="indent">A short expedition from Tokyo, and one
comfortable for the motorist, is to the prehistoric
caves&mdash;Hyaku Ana&mdash;near Konosu.
These are some two hundred cave-dwellings
that have been uncovered on the side of a cliff.
They have long, low entrances, and vary from
tiny holes to caves ten feet square and high
enough for a man to stand in. The pieces of
jewelry and pottery which have been found
there are small help in reconstructing the life
of the troglodytes&mdash;&quot;earth spiders,&quot; the
Japanese call them&mdash;who may have lived there
some thousands of years ago.</p>

<p class="indent">Another trip from Tokyo<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> is to the Boshu
Peninsula. The tourist will have an excellent
opportunity of getting a few glimpses of unfamiliar
Japan without going very far afield.
The road follows the seashore most of the way
and offers a great variety of scenery&mdash;pine-clad
hills, rice fields, pretty gardens, and fishing
villages with the ocean breaking on rocky
cliffs. There is little chance for speeding, as
the highway is often narrow and passes
through many tunnels with sharp curves, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
the trip was made without any trouble by Mr.
S.&#39;s large fifty h. p. Clement-Bayard.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">Mr. S. and friends started from Tokyo after
tiffin, and spent the night at Inage, a small village
two miles from Chiba, where there was a
quiet inn. Next day, they drove along the coast
southwest to Tateyama, which is a popular
bathing resort, reaching there in time for tiffin.
The views along the way, both of the hills and
of Tokyo Bay, were very fine. They went on
to Katsu-ura for the night, passing Mera, which
is an important fishing village at the extreme
tip of the peninsula, built on a cliff near a
lighthouse. It was here that the <i>Dakota</i> was
wrecked in 1909. Part of the way the volcano
on Vries Island is to be seen.</p>

<p class="indent">Near Katsu-ura is the birthplace of the famous
Buddhist saint, Nichiren. He was born
in 1222 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>, and became a priest at the age of
fifteen. His doctrines being considered unsafe,
he was sentenced to death, but the executioner&#39;s
sword was broken by lightning, and orders came
from the Regent to release him. Various well-known
temples have been erected in his memory.</p>

<p class="indent">Next day the return trip was made by way
of Ichinomiya, Hamano, and Chiba. The entire
excursion can be made in two days, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
with an extra day one could also take in Narita,
which has a very interesting temple and is well
worth visiting.</p>

<p class="indent">Mountaineering by motor is also possible in
some parts of Japan. A successful trip was
made from Tokyo over the Torii Toge not long
ago, although the road left much to be desired,
being narrow, tortuous, and often washed away
in places&mdash;between Azuma-Bashi and Narai it
was especially bad. This pass gets its name
from the massive granite <i>torii</i> at the top, and
is over four thousand feet above the sea. The
road over the Shiojiri Toge, which is thirty-four
hundred feet high, is so well engineered
that it was found possible to get to the top on
middle gear. The views along the way are said
to be of the finest, and the &quot;Kame-ya&quot; at
Shimono-Suwa, a very comfortable hotel with
natural hot baths and an obliging landlord.</p>

<p class="indent">One motorist found difficulty in garaging his
car, and it had to be left under the wide eaves
of the roof of the hotel. The ingenious landlord,
however, borrowed a huge sheet of thick
oil-paper and covered it all up snugly and securely
from the weather, as well as from the
attentions of a crowd of boys who had gathered
round.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I found the boys troublesome everywhere,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
this traveller writes; &quot;they were not content
to look, but must finger everything. On one
occasion they turned an oil-tap and lost me half
a gallon of precious oil which could not be replaced....
After this I tied up the oil-tap
every night and took the wires off the accumulators,
for on another occasion I found that a
boy had switched these on.&quot; Such hints may
prove useful to the prospective motorist.</p>

<p class="indent">The road from Tokyo to Nikko is good, except
at one point, where it crosses a river.
Next to Miyanoshita, this is the most popular
excursion, for the temples are glorious and
the hotel is good. We did not hear whether
the road from Nikko to Chuzenji was passable.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese have a saying that you must
call nothing beautiful until you have seen
Nikko. L. says nothing is beautiful after
you have seen Nikko. It is supreme, the
climax. In 1889 he journeyed three hours to
Utsunomiya, and then five hours by <i>kuruma</i> to
Nikko, through the wonderful avenue of cryptomerias,
with the foliage meeting overhead.
This avenue is said to extend for fifty miles.
When the temples at Nikko were being raised,
some three hundred years ago, many nobles
presented portions of them; but some, poorer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
than the rest, for their share planted these trees
as an approach to the temples.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">THE WONDERFUL AVENUE OF CRYPTOMERIAS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">L. was not disappointed in going there
on a later visit, for the great trees still
stood solemnly above the gorgeous temples, and
peace and religious quiet were to be found
there as always. On the other side of the rushing
river, however, there was a change, for
hotels and European comforts had been provided.</p>

<p class="indent">I am not sure whether one can motor from
Tokyo to Fukushima or not, but, in any event,
it would be worth trying. We went there on a
former visit, staying at a Japanese inn, sleeping
on mats in comforters. Next day we went
on, part of the way by train, part by jinrikisha,
to the &quot;eight hundred and eight islands,&quot; the
most fascinating place in the world. We took
a boat and went in and out among the islands
until we came to Matsushima, a little fishing
town which is considered the first of the Sankei&mdash;&quot;the
three finest views in Japan&quot;&mdash;on
account of its exceptionally beautiful sea view.
The islands are covered with queer, stunted
pines, among which quaint temples are to be
seen. Even now in the stillness of the night
I can hear their bells, like a mysterious, musical
moan.</p>

The following condensed account of a trip by
motorcycle from Tokyo to Kyoto and beyond
may be of use to the traveller. The distance is
about three hundred and forty miles. Three and
a half gallons of petrol were consumed, which is
more than would have been used if the second
and third days&#39; ride had not been in the teeth
of a gale. The machine was a 2 3-4 h. p. twin-cylinder
Douglas with free engine clutch and
two-speed gear. A lightweight of this sort has
proved most suitable for Japan, for there are
dozens of occasions&mdash;lifting in and out of
boats, up steps, pushing over stony river-beds&mdash;when
one is glad of its lightness. One never
wishes for more speed. Allowing time for rest,
food, and casual stops, not over a hundred
miles can be made in a day with any pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">On this expedition the cyclist went by way
of Kozu and stayed over a day at Shizuoka. It
is fifty-five miles from there to Fukuroi, where
he lunched, and then continued on to Maisaka
for the night.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;From Maisaka,&quot; he says, &quot;one can cross
over the Hamano Lagoon to Arai by ferry, one
can take the train over the bridge, or make the
circuit of the lagoon. As there was a strong
gale blowing the ferry did not put out, so this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
night was spent at Benten-jima, a pleasant
little bathing resort at the mouth of the lagoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning, he left Arai at nine o&#39;clock.
About two miles out there was a very stiff hill,
which is frequently mentioned in pictures of
Tokaido travel. The ascent commenced immediately
after a sharp turn out of a village
street, so that it was impossible to get a good
start. The view over the sea from the top was
splendid, however, and the run down to Toyohashi
among slopes blazing with azaleas proved
delightful.</p>

<p class="indent">At Atsuta, fifty-five miles from Toyohashi,
the cyclist left the Tokaido and passed through
one of the suburbs of Nagoya. This is the third
city of Japan, Tokyo being the first and Osaka
the second in size. It is famous for its potteries
and especially for its castle, which has a
keep typical of the ancient feudal times and
often shown in Japanese art. The castle is in
fairly good preservation and is one of the best
specimens of architecture in the country. The
central building is a massive structure one
hundred and fifty feet high, surmounted by two
golden dolphins, which may be seen from a tremendous
distance glistening in the sun. One
of them was exhibited at Vienna in 1873; on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
its way home it was lost with the ship, but
was finally recovered at great expense.</p>

<p class="indent">After Nagoya, Kano was reached. Here one
turns to the left, without entering Gifu, and
proceeds along the Nakasendo&mdash;the great
highway that connects Tokyo and Kyoto by
way of the mountains while the Tokaido runs
nearer the coast. Maibara, on the shores of
Lake Biwa, was reached that evening at eight
o&#39;clock; from there it was a straight run to
Kyoto.</p>

<p class="indent">Lake Biwa, the largest piece of fresh water
in Japan, is about forty-five miles long. It
is surrounded on all sides by hills and is
supposed to have been produced by an earthquake
early in the third century before
Christ.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">LAKE BIWA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It is also possible to go from Tokyo to Kyoto
by way of Atami, but it is not a very good trip.
Those who try it generally get on the train at
Kozu and get off again at Gotimba&mdash;a method
much easier for a motorcycle than for a car, of
course.</p>

<p class="indent">There are a thousand things to do and see in
Kyoto, but if one is there in cherry blossom
season one must not fail to see the glorious
old cherry tree so widely renowned. Near it is
the Mound of Ears. Osame told me that long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
ago, after a great battle in Korea, the returning
victors brought with them their enemies&#39;
ears and noses, instead of the heads, to show
how many Koreans they had killed. These
trophies were buried in a mound to commemorate
the battle.</p>

<p class="indent">A trip was made from Kyoto to Ama-no-Hashidate&mdash;another
of the &quot;three finest
views&quot;&mdash;by way of Suchi and Kawamori.
For some miles the road out of Kyoto is bad;
there is a long climb before Kameoka and a
steep, long, but well-graded pass between Sonobe
and Kinokiyama. The whole of this day&#39;s
journey lay through beautiful, well-wooded
country with glimpses of the Yuragawa as one
rode along its left bank, then over a splendid
hilly coast road into Miyazu&mdash;a distance of
about ninety miles in all.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">
<a name="illo_429" id="illo_429"></a><img class="border" src="images/illo_429.jpg" width="700" height="467" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">AMA-NO-HASHIDATE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The return was made by way of Shin-Maizuru,
where one turns to the right after getting
into the broad main street and soon reaches the
coast again near Takahama. From there on to
Obama the scenery would be hard to surpass
with its views of the coast and of the wooded
hills inland covered with azaleas, wisteria and
other brilliant flowers. The road from Imazu
skirts the western shores of Lake Biwa and is
very narrow and bumpy until within ten miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
of Otsu. Indeed, the roads, after leaving the
coast, are often so narrow that there would be
no pleasure in taking a car over them.</p>

<p class="indent">L. and I found most of the roads around
Kyoto good. A few of them present difficulties,
such as the one from Kyoto to Kamazawa,
but from this point they are again
fine, though many hills and dangerous spots
are still to be met with. On a former visit we
went in &#39;rickshas to the foot of these hills, passing
green fields of rice and reaching the Harashiyawa
River, which flows rapidly into the
plain. We took a flat-bottomed boat and were
towed and poled up the swift water between
the steep, wooded banks, where it was very
lovely. We had tea at a tea-house on the bank,
and watched the fishermen in boats, and looked
out over the pleasant landscape in the sunset
glow of crimson and gold before the purple
shadows fell across the plains.</p>

<p class="indent">From Kyoto to Otsu, which is on the shore
of Lake Biwa, is about an hour&#39;s ride by rail.
There one takes a small steamer up the lake to
Nagahama, where, after a tiffin of carp with
rice and <i>soy</i> at a tea-house, one may take a
train again for Nara.</p>

<p class="indent">One may also go from Kyoto to Nara direct
by <i>kuruma</i>&mdash;a day&#39;s journey. There are interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
temples to visit on the hillsides along
the road&mdash;popular shrines where thousands of
pilgrims with jangling staves, and holiday-makers
taking tea and cakes, enjoy themselves
simply in their beautiful surroundings. We
passed among them, beneath the great gates
guarded by fantastic demon gods, green and
red and blue, and into temples, gorgeous but
often dilapidated and dusty, past pagodas and
through long avenues of stone lanterns. At
Nara we saw the Golden Pavilion and the Silver
Pavilion, the summer places of retired princes.
There are entrancing gardens with little ponds
filled with goldfish, tiny bridges and imitation
mountains, the &quot;wash-the-moon&quot; cascade, and
the platforms where warriors used to sit and
look at the moon&mdash;those fierce, two-sworded
warriors of other days.</p>

<p class="indent">The old temples of Nara have stood there
silently for over a thousand years, beneath the
gaze of that huge, ungainly bronze Buddha who
looks down with half-shut eyes, one hand held
up in benediction, the other resting on his knee.
He sits on his open lotus flower beneath the
tall, solemn cryptomerias,&mdash;this wonderful
Dai Butsu, the largest in all Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">We wandered through the groves and the
park where the dainty wild deer are so friendly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
On the hillside above is a temple to Kwannon,
over a thousand years old, standing out from
the dark green of the pines. Farther along is
a Shinto temple, low and with galleries and
many lanterns. Here we saw priests praying&mdash;shaven-headed
<i>bonzes</i> in their robes&mdash;at
whom pilgrims were tossing coppers. Beyond
is the Wakamiya, where, for a consideration,
some priestesses perform a dance called <i>kagura</i>
while priests chant and play the flute and
the tom-tom. As we went by, we saw a veiled
priestess dancing there in true Eastern style.
At the foot of the slope is a five-storied pagoda,
black with age, for it dates back to the eighth
century.</p>

<p class="center">ANCIENT TEMPLE NEAR NARA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Nikko and Nara! The one a place of some
three hundred years, gilded and coloured&mdash;the
other ancient, and sombre, and impressive.</p>

<p class="indent">From Nara to Osaka you pass more old temples,
where they say an eye of Buddha is secretly
guarded. Osaka is sometimes called the
Venice of Japan, on account of its many canals
and bridges. The castle here must have been
by far the most magnificent in the country before
it was destroyed by fire. The moats and
foundations that remain are splendid specimens
of masonry.</p>

<p class="indent">From Kyoto to Kobe is a ride of two and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
half hours in the train. The road skirts the
hills which bound Kyoto, passes Osaka, and
follows some rivers that flow higher than the
level of the country&mdash;indeed, the road runs
through tunnels under three large streams!</p>

<p class="indent">The terracing of the land is very marked
along this route. Japanese methods of farming
and irrigation require that the land shall
be level, and so the country is all plotted off
into little irregular terraces. The ground is
saturated with water, which stands to a depth
of several inches around the growing crops.
Paddy-fields are really ponds of standing
water, while a farm is a marsh, the house alone
rising above the surface. Farmers, while taking
in their rice or plowing their fields, work
with the water and thick black mud up to their
knees.</p>

<p class="indent">Kobe is the foreign name applied to Hyogo,
the treaty-port. It is next to Yokohama in
commercial importance. The foreigners in
Kobe&mdash;English, German and American&mdash;have
a very pleasant club, and pretty bungalows
on the hills back of the town. A beautiful
waterfall and the Temple of the Moon are not
far away.</p>

<p class="indent">Maiko, in the province of Harima, is one of
the most enchanting spots in this part of Japan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>
It is near the upper entrance to the Inland Sea,
not far from Kobe. Nothing can be more fairy-like
and mysterious than the spreading, twisted
trees on the white sand there in the moonlight.
<i>Maiko</i> means dancing girl, and the place gets
its name from the effect given the ancient pines
when the wind blows the sand into shifting
scarfs about them.</p>

<p class="indent">Lake Shinji, on the northern coast, is also
one of the most interesting places in the country
and one seldom seen by foreigners. Ogo-Harito
is famous for its giant rocks washed by
the sea into strange and fantastic shapes. It
is the female spirit of the west coast, while
Matsushima is considered the male spirit of
the east coast.</p>

<p class="indent">If one has time, Yahakii should be seen, for
it is a very strange valley with its enormous
conventional terraces made by nature. At the
bottom of the canyon is a swift river, and temples
are perched here and there on high crags.
Koro Halcho, in the province of Kii, is very
beautiful, especially in the spring when the
gorge with its deep cliffs is made lovelier still
with wild flowers. A motorcyclist would find
inviting trips in Hokkaido, where the roads are
not bad, though it is rather difficult getting
there. Over on the other coast, from Nazano
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
to Navetta, and around Kamisana, there are
good roads.</p>

<p class="indent">Our trip through the Inland Sea, from Kobe
to Nagasaki, was one of the most delightful
experiences that we had in Japan. We chartered
a boat at Kobe, after an extravagant
comedy of errors. L. went on board at midnight
to examine it, and the agent did not discover
until after the business was finished that
it was not the boat which he intended L. to see
at all; but the captain was too quick for him,
and seized the opportunity to make a good
bargain.</p>

<p class="indent">It turned out very well indeed for us. The
steamer was of two hundred tons burden, one
hundred and fifty feet long, with very comfortable
cabins&mdash;two small ones in European style
and one large one extending entirely across the
boat, with mats in native style, where Japanese
passengers may lie side by side on their comforters.
We took our own supplies, and had a
very good cook until he went off one night on
a spree.</p>

<p class="indent">We went aboard one evening, and sailed at
daybreak next morning, being awakened by the
rattling of the chain and the churning of the
propeller. Soon we were gliding out of the
harbour between the shipping, just as the sun

came up out of the Eastern Ocean, chasing the
shadows down the hillsides and bathing the
shore in a glorious crimson. We turned Hyogo
Point and headed for Akashi Straits, to enter
the Inland Sea, passing palisades like those on
the Hudson.</p>

<p class="indent">All day long we went through the archipelago
of green and yellow islands. At first the sea
was glassy, then gently ruffled, and junks and
sampans with queer sails glided by. Toward
evening we passed into even narrower passages
and straits, and the moon rose, all silver in
the twilight sky, while we turned many times,
now to the right, now to the left, finally coming
to anchor off the twinkling lights of Onomichi.
We landed after dinner and walked through
the little town, then sat out on deck and sang
in the flooding moonlight.</p>

<p class="indent">When we left next morning it was to pass
more promontories on beautiful islands, lovely
mountains rising behind, and picturesque
shores fringed with tiny trees all green and
purple in the haze. In the afternoon the clouds
and rain that crossed our path only added to
and varied the loveliness of the approach to
Hiroshima.</p>

<p class="indent">During the day we had an unsurpassed panorama
of Japanese scenery, with grotesque,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
broken islands fringed with pine, and ravined
mountains dipping down into the calm blue
waters, on which the quaintest and most unreal
of sampans and junks were idly floating. We
felt as if we were passing through a miniature
ocean with its islands and old-world villages
constantly appearing and disappearing in the
rising, shifting mist. No wonder the Japanese
believe in ghosts and in Bahu, the Eater of
Dreams!</p>

<p class="indent">As the sun went down we rounded the enchanted
island of Miyajima&mdash;the third of the
&quot;three finest views&quot;&mdash;and glided into the bay
before the famous temple. When it grew
darker the four hundred lanterns of bronze and
stone along the water&#39;s edge were lighted for
us. The temple itself is built on piles, and the
<i>torii</i> stands far out from the shore. We were
sculled across the still waters in a sampan.
The tide was at its highest, and the hundreds
of little lights were reflected in its glassy surface.
Slowly we drifted beneath the great <i>torii</i>
to the temple entrance. Once more the Spell of
Japan stole over us.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">THE GREAT <i>TORII</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The sunrise next morning was too beautiful
for words. We appeared to be coming out from
a rosy dawn into a grey, dim future, as the
sun came up through a pearly mist and the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
clouds rose in wreaths about the tops of the
strange mountains, making pictures such as
the art of Japan loves to depict. Tiny straw-sailed
boats appeared and disappeared mysteriously.
It was all very silent and lovely.</p>

<p class="indent">Later in the day we climbed the hill behind
the temple, then came down and bathed, having
tea at a delightful little tea-house, taking tiffin
ashore beneath the tiny-leafed maples near a
brook; we went aboard in the late afternoon,
and, hoisting anchor, steamed away.</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning we saw the sun rise at Moji.
We passed Shimonoseki and then steamed out
into the China Sea, keeping the picturesque
shore of Kyushu in sight all the way. We
picked our course through the outlying islands
and the swirling straits of Hirado, and reached
Nagasaki late at night. Contenting ourselves
with one look at its twinkling lights, we retired.
Morning showed us once more its beautiful harbour,
the mountains range on range behind it,
and the city itself on either side, the houses
rising above each other on long terraces to the
summits of the hills on which Nagasaki is built.</p>

<p class="indent">Near us a big ship was coaling&mdash;a wonderful
sight to one who beholds it for the first time.
It was surrounded by countless barges upon
which were swarming crowds of Japanese&mdash;men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span>
women and children. Forming a long line
that reached from the barges up a ladder into
the ship&#39;s hold, they handed baskets of coal
from one to the other, so that a continuous
stream poured steadily into the ship. The
strangeness of the costumes, the unusual sight
of women doing a man&#39;s work&mdash;many of them
with babies strapped to their backs&mdash;added
to the interest of the busy scene. Down in the
hold, where the heat must have been suffocating,
they plodded on, men and women, clad
chiefly in coal-dust. All day long they worked
away with happy smiles, the babies bobbing up
and down on their mothers&#39; backs, doubtless
wondering what it was all about. The sight
reminded me of the passage in the Æneid,
where the poet speaks of the ants as &quot;tiny
toilers of giant industry,&quot; and describes them
carrying crumbs in their mouths to the common
storehouse in a seemingly never-ending
line.</p>

<p class="indent">As we steamed out of the harbour, the green
hills rose steeply from the water with houses
and shrines peeping through the trees, backed
by a still higher range of hills which were
finally lost in the blue distance or broke off
into crags and cliffs.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Spell of Japan owes no small part
of its potency to the abundant flowers,
which weave about the land an ever-changing
veil of bright colours and
exquisite textures. First appear the fragrant
plums, earliest of the &quot;One Hundred Flowers,&quot;
and the freesias, and the wonderful display
of cherry blossoms in March and April,
then the wisteria and azalea, the iris and the
peony, &quot;the flower of prosperity&quot;&mdash;in China
it is called &quot;the queen of flowers&quot;&mdash;in July
the lotus, and in the autumn the chrysanthemum,
&quot;the long-lasting plant.&quot; Of all these
the cherry and the chrysanthemum are the most
famous.</p>

<p class="indent">The plum, an emblem of chastity, is enjoyed
chiefly by the intellectual. There is only a
breath of flower on the gnarled stock, a mystery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span>
of white or pink or red, which requires
close study to find delight in the manner in
which the blossoms scatter irregularly on the
beautiful, twisting branches, silvery with lichen.</p>

<p class="indent">This charming little poem by Sosei refers
to the plum as the herald of spring:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Amid the branches of the silv&#39;ry bowers</span><br />
<span class="i0">The nightingale doth sing: perchance he knows</span><br />
<span class="i0">That spring hath come, and takes the later snows</span><br />
<span class="i0">For the white petals of the plum&#39;s sweet flowers.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The cherry, being gayer and more profuse,
is more popular with the people. It is called
&quot;the king of flowers,&quot; and especially represents
abundance and vitality. It is therefore
a fitting symbol of the national population.
When the cherry is in blossom, the Japanese
make excursions to view particularly beautiful
trees, and as they feast and float in their pleasure
boats, they enjoy even the fluttering petals,
whether seen in the bright sunlight or the pale
moonbeams. So high an official as a Prime
Minister will take a day&#39;s journey for the sight
of a cherry tree in bloom.</p>

<p class="indent">A Japanese of the olden time has beautifully
pictured the blossoming cherry trees: &quot;When
in spring the trees flower, it is as if fleeciest
masses of cloud faintly tinged by sunset had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg&nbsp;328]</span>
floated down from the highest sky to fold themselves
about the branches.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The wisteria is an especial favourite with
foreigners, no doubt for the reason that we
seldom see in America drooping clusters of
such length&mdash;the length of an umbrella, as the
Japanese measure. It is believed that this
flower attains great size and beauty if the roots
are nourished with the rice wine of the country,
and there is at Kameido a tree producing unusually
fine blossoms, at the base of which visitors
are accustomed to empty their wine cups.</p>

<p class="indent">Every one is familiar with the beautiful and
varied colours of the Japanese iris, as the bulbs
are shipped to all parts of the world. The
peony often measures nine inches across, and
some of the tree peonies have petals of a lovely
silky sheen and texture. It is sometimes called
&quot;the plant of twenty days,&quot; because it is said
to keep fresh for that length of time. In art,
it forms a constant decoration on temple and
palace walls, and it is supposed, like the lotus,
to have medicinal properties.</p>

<p class="indent">The lotus is not used for festivities or rejoicing
in Japan, but for sacred ceremonies and
funerals. As it is a Buddhist flower, and as
Buddhism started in India, it is sometimes
called the national flower of India. It grows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg&nbsp;329]</span>
wonderfully, however, on the castle moats in
Tokyo.</p>

<p class="indent">In its season the chrysanthemum pervades
the country. It blossoms in every garden, it
grows by the roadside, and it stands in every
tiny shop. Each loyal son of Dai Nippon has
a flower upon which he may rest his eye and
with which he may delight his artistic and
patriotic sense. The sixteen-petalled flower is
the crest of the Emperor, and no one else is
allowed to use that as a design, although the
blossom is often reproduced in decoration with
fewer petals. The people go on pilgrimages in
order to gaze with semi-religious awe upon
&quot;the long-lasting plant&quot;; the Emperor gives
a chrysanthemum party; and the season of this
most decorative of flowers is made one of general
rejoicing.</p>

<p class="indent">The chrysanthemum has been cultivated in
China for more than two thousand years, says
Dr. Bryan in the <i>Japan Magazine</i>, and there is
evidence of its being cherished in Egypt a
thousand years before it is mentioned in China.
Whether it came from Egypt to China, or vice
versa, it is impossible now to determine, but
the Chinese like to regard it as a product of
the Far East. Confucius mentions it in 500
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, under the name of <i>liki</i>. From China it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span>
was brought to Japan, where it has reached
its highest development.</p>

<p class="indent">What the lotus was to Egypt, the fleur-de-lys
to France, and the Tudor rose to England, the
chrysanthemum is to Japan. The flower is
single, yet many. It is a unity in variety, and
a variety springing from one undivided centre.
The Japanese call it &quot;binding flower,&quot; for just
as its petals bind themselves together on the
surface, so the Emperor and the people are
forever bound together in indissoluble union.
It was probably chosen as the most natural and
artistic emblem of the sun, but both this and
the cherry blossom, like the Emperor and his
people, are considered children of that luminary,
whose orb resplendent stands for the
country as a whole. Many a maiden of Japan
is named after &quot;the binding flower,&quot; and its
use is very typical of Japanese art and life.</p>

<p class="indent">At one chrysanthemum show we saw nine
hundred blossoms on a single plant, and the
flowers were arranged to form figures of warriors
and ladies of long ago, from the fairy
tales of Old Japan. At Dango-zaka, a place of
professional gardens, an exhibition is held each
year, for which visitors are charged two <i>sen</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
a peep. Here we saw wonderful figures made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg&nbsp;331]</span>
of flowers&mdash;one of an elephant and his rider
being thirty-six feet high. In the grottoes and
rockeries of the garden were other life-like figures.
It was a sort of &quot;Madame Tussaud&#39;s&quot;
with the characters in flowers instead of wax.
On revolving stages were rocks and mountains,
horses and men in all sorts of attitudes, brilliant,
curious and interesting&mdash;all made of
flowers. One scene represented Commodore
Perry&#39;s reception by the Shogun.</p>

<p class="indent">The Imperial Chrysanthemum Party has

<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Formerly, as the guests came before the Emperor,
a vase of lovely blossoms, to which was
attached a bag of frankincense and myrrh, was
placed in front of His Majesty, and cups of
<i>saké</i> with the petals floating in them were
handed around. In the annals of China we read
the explanation of this custom:</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_11_11">
<span class="label">[11]</span></a>
For this description, also, I am largely indebted to the
writings of Dr. Bryan.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">There was once upon a time, as the story
goes, a man who was warned of an impending
calamity, which could be warded off, he was
told, by attaching a bag of myrrh to his elbow
and ascending a certain hill, where he was to
drink <i>saké</i> with the petals of the chrysanthemum
floating in it. The man did as was suggested,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg&nbsp;332]</span>
but on returning home he found all his
domestic animals dead. When he informed his
teacher that the plan had not worked, the
former replied that the calamity was to have
come upon his family, and that by acting upon
the warning he had averted it, throwing the
vengeance on the animals instead.</p>

<p class="indent">The Emperor&#39;s Chrysanthemum Party is
now conducted in a somewhat different manner
from that of the olden time. It is held in
the flower palace of the Imperial garden at
Akasaka. Upon the arrival of the Emperor
and his suite at the main gate, the Japanese
national anthem begins, and the guests, who
are already in their places, line the pathway
on either side, bowing as Their Majesties, the
Emperor and Empress, and the princes of the
blood, file past. Then the guests fall into line
after the Imperial party and follow to the place
where the feast is prepared.</p>

<p class="indent">The Emperor takes his place on the dais
at the head of the marquee, and receives all
the representatives of foreign countries and
some of the higher officials of the Empire. As
each diplomat appears in the Mikado&#39;s presence
he bows three times, and his felicitations
are translated into Japanese by an interpreter
who stands near His Majesty. The Empress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[pg&nbsp;333]</span>
is seated on a dais slightly lower but very
near, and all who approach the Emperor bow
also to the Empress. This function over, the
Emperor sips a glass of wine, which is the
signal for the feast to commence. As soon as
the feasting is ended the band strikes up, and
His Majesty begins to prepare for his departure.
The guests again line up, and bow in
farewell as the Imperial procession files out,
then they enjoy the view of the superb chrysanthemums.</p>

<p class="indent">The Imperial Cherry Blossom Party in the
spring is held in the same garden at Akasaka,
and is conducted in much the same way, an
elaborate feast being laid in a great marquee.
The palace in these grounds originally belonged
to Prince Kishu, but after the burning of the
Emperor&#39;s palace in 1873 this one was used
as a temporary abode of the Imperial family,
and was afterward the residence of the Crown
Prince, now Emperor.</p>

<p class="indent">In the province of Kai there is a hill called
Chrysanthemum Mount, overhanging a river
into which the petals fall. It is believed that
long life is assured by drinking the water.
Among the people the custom also survives
of placing small blossoms or petals in the
cup during the wine-drinking that takes place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg&nbsp;334]</span>
at the festival on the ninth day of the ninth
month.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese fondness for flowers is not bestowed
chiefly on the rare and costly varieties
produced by the florist&#39;s skill, but is lavished
upon the familiar blossoms of every day. Love
of nature is shown in their pilgrimages for
seeing flowers, picking mushrooms, gathering
shells, and even for viewing the moon, which
form their favourite holiday excursions. One
of the prettiest conceits of the Japanese imagination
is that which regards the snowflakes as
the flowers of winter, and has added snow-viewing
to the list of flower-festivals.</p>

<p class="indent">Parties are even formed to rise at dawn and
go out to see the morning-glories open. I can
testify, too, from my own experience that they
are well rewarded, for Japanese morning-glories
are worth seeing. One day when our train
was delayed at a village, the station master
invited us to view the morning-glories in his
tiny garden, about twenty feet square. The
colours were so beautiful that they were really
a feast for the eyes. Some were pale in tint,
some brilliant, and some had crinkled flowers
and leaves.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the Japanese popular names for
plants are some interesting ones. The tufted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg&nbsp;335]</span>
grass that grows on the hillsides has the delightful
name of &quot;lion&#39;s moustache.&quot; The
barberry, which grows wild in Japan as it
does here, is popularly styled &quot;snake-can&#39;t-climb-up,&quot;
on account of its thorns, the idea
being that the snake wants the berries, but the
thorns keep him off. The little pachysandra,
sometimes used here for borders in gardens,
bears the high-sounding title of &quot;noble plant.&quot;
We are surprised at this until we discover
that it is very hardy, adapts itself to any
surroundings, and blossoms under the unfavourable
conditions of early spring. Because
of these qualities, rather than for anything
striking in its outward appearance, it is called
noble. It is also a symbol of good luck, perhaps
in recognition of the fact that a person&#39;s good
fortune comes chiefly from his hardihood,
adaptability and power to overcome obstacles.</p>

<p class="indent">On one of our visits to Japan we imitated
the fashion of the country and made pilgrimages
to view the lotus, which was in full bloom
in July, its pink and white blossoms almost
covering the waters of the ponds. Again in
the autumn, we went on excursions to enjoy
the charming colours of the maples. Often we
took jinrikishas and went to an inn by a rippling
brook, where we spent the day, eating the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg&nbsp;336]</span>
native food with chopsticks from little lacquer
trays, and looking out from the balcony of polished
wood upon the bright, sharp-pointed
leaves dancing in the sunshine.</p>

<p class="indent">At the various festival seasons of the year,
different flowers and plants are used, either
alone or in combination with others. For instance,
the pine and the bamboo appear among
New Year decorations; the iris is the flower
of the Boys&#39; Festival; fruits and berries are
used on the first day of the eighth month. Such
occasions as the coming of age of a young man,
a promotion in rank, farewell gatherings, death
anniversaries, poetry meetings, tea ceremonials
and incense burnings, all are adorned by their
appropriate flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">Japanese flower arrangement differs fundamentally
from that of the West, and includes
much more than the mere massing of a cluster
of blossoms of beautiful colour and texture, set
off by a sufficient number of leaves of some
kind. <i>Ike-bana</i>, as they call their art, considers
the flower as a mere detail and of little beauty
apart from its proper place on the stem. In
addition to grace and beauty of line and an
entire absence of crowding, it requires the expression
of the thought that what you have
before you is not simply cut flowers but a growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[pg&nbsp;337]</span>
plant&mdash;which must always have an uneven
number of branches. Buds and even withered
leaves are used as well as flowers, in order to
suggest the natural mode of growth. By keeping
the stems together for a few inches at the
base a strong plant is indicated, springing from
the surface of the water, which is supposed to
represent the surface of the earth.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><i>IKE-BANA</i> OR FLOWER ARRANGEMENT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">As we learn the rules of <i>Ike-bana</i>, we do not
wonder that it has been the study and diversion
of philosophers, generals and priests. The
three branches with which the arrangement
starts are named Heaven, Man and Earth.
Heaven, the longest branch, must be one and
one-half times the height of the vase and must
stand in the centre of the cluster. Man should
be one-half the length of Heaven, and Earth
one-half as long as Man. These sprays are
bent into the desired curves before they are
placed in the vase. Finally, but with great
care, every leaf or flower that hides another
must be ruthlessly cut off.</p>

<p class="indent">By the use of special flowers and the varying
disposition of the sprays the season of the year
or the particular occasion for which the arrangement
is designed may be indicated. For
example, unusual curves of the branches suggest
the high winds of March; white flowers are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[pg&nbsp;338]</span>
used at a housewarming, or they signify water
to put out a fire; evergreens or chrysanthemums
are used when a youth comes into his
property, to express the wish that he may long
keep his possessions.</p>

<p class="indent">Following out the Buddhist idea of preserving
life as long as possible, the Japanese make
their vases with a wide mouth, so that the water
they contain may be exposed to the air. This
makes it necessary to support the branches,
and various kinds of holders have been devised
for this purpose. Both vases and holders are
made of basket-work, porcelain, bronze and
bamboo, and according to their shape they are
called by such names as &quot;Singing Mouth,&quot;
&quot;Crane Neck,&quot; and &quot;Rampant Lion.&quot; Hanging
baskets in the form of boats, too, are popular,
and receive names like &quot;Cloud Boat&quot;
and &quot;Dragon-head Boat.&quot; In summer low,
shallow vases are used, which suggest coolness
by the extent of water surface exposed.</p>

<p class="indent">According to the law of <i>Ike-bana</i>, vases
should be nine-tenths filled with water in spring
and autumn, in hot weather they must be brimful,
in winter only four-fifths full, and even less
in very cold weather. Pebbles may cover the
bottom of the vase in imitation of a river-bed,
both white and black ones being used. An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg&nbsp;339]</span>
effective arrangement is to place three large
stones on top of the small ones&mdash;quite a high
rock to represent a mountain, a second flat one,
and a third between the others in height.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese love to decorate their houses
with flowers, but we might say on entering,
Where are they? Why, in the most honoured
place of all! On the raised platform of the
alcove, perhaps beside the image of some god,
stands a large vase with a few carefully arranged
branches of flowers, or maybe of leaves
alone. These are enough. You feel no need
of anything more.</p>

<p class="indent">The table decorations made for Europeans
are especially interesting. They are often
placed directly on the tablecloth. One that we
saw contained a conventionalized Fuji in evergreen
needles, like a flat print, overhung with
cotton wool to imitate clouds. Sometimes miniature
landscapes are formed in a box, for anything
tiny delights the Japanese, and they
spend whole days arranging such things. The
Inland Sea is often represented in blue and
white sand, with real earth for the shores and
the islands, while small pine branches are introduced
to look like twisted trees. Boats and
fishes are put in the blue sand, and small temples
set up on the shore. As every imaginable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg&nbsp;340]</span>
toy is made by the Japanese, the scene can be
varied according to the taste of the designer&mdash;I
have even seen tiny European ladies imitated,

<p class="indent">In the miniature landscapes which Watanabe
devised for us he used dwarfed trees in almost
every instance, and imitated water and waterfalls
with sands of different colours. For the
Fuji of these pictures he sometimes used one
of those oddly shaped pebbles that abound in
Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">On Washington&#39;s Birthday Watanabe surpassed
himself in this sort of decoration. He
represented Washington City by a diminutive
Capitol and White House and Washington Monument,
set in a park-like arrangement of gravel
drives and avenues of tiny trees. Among these
appeared absurd little equestrian monuments
and decorative detail of various kinds. As he
had never been in America we asked him how
he had pictured it so correctly. He answered
that he found a photograph of the Capitol in
a book, and took it to a friend, who made models
of the buildings for him. He also had arranged
a large cherry tree (which, because it had artificial
flowers, appeared to be in full bloom),
into which the proverbial hatchet was stuck.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[pg&nbsp;341]</span>
The Japanese art of landscape gardening
arose from their fondness for nature, which led
them to reproduce in miniature the scenery
visible from their homes. No doubt Chinese
influence had its effect upon this art, as upon
many others, through the medium of the Buddhist
priesthood.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the earliest examples of landscape
gardening were the temple groves of Nara.
From the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries
gardens took on a freer form, more like that of
the present time, but the dried-up water scenery
was used, showing the hollow of a lake
dry, as if in time of drought, sometimes combined
with the bare mountain. In the fifteenth
century, when the tea ceremony was introduced,
a special form of garden was devoted to its
use, while at the same time the art of flower
arrangement flourished. Soami, about 1480,
and Enshiu, a hundred years later, are among
the best known landscape artists. &quot;The Rocky
Ocean,&quot; &quot;The Wide River,&quot; &quot;The Mountain
Torrent,&quot; and &quot;The Lake Wave&quot; are fanciful
names given to different styles of gardening.</p>

<p class="indent">A Japanese garden is generally enclosed by
a bamboo paling, often in some pretty design,
which may surround the house as well. There
should be one high point in the garden, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[pg&nbsp;342]</span>
dominates the whole, and it may contain a
miniature mountain, dwarf trees, stones, and
a tea-house with a gateway at the entrance. If
possible, there should be water with a bridge
over it, and a cascade to bring luck.</p>

<p class="indent">From the varying arrangement of these features,
we find hill gardens, flat gardens, finished,
intermediary or rough gardens. On our
place in Brookline, Massachusetts, we have a
Japanese hill garden. The flat effect is especially
popular in Japan, with its gravel walks
and stone lanterns in different sizes and designs;
but whichever style is chosen, it must
be so planned as to present its best appearance
from the house.</p>

<p class="indent">No garden is complete without one or more
lanterns, which are placed, if possible, by the
water, that their light may be reflected in the
pond. The stone basins for washing the hands
vary in style, and so, too, do the gateways;
these sometimes have thatched roofs, which
provide shelter, and can be made very attractive.
There are twisted dwarf trees here and
there, of course, and variously shaped stepping-stones
set in regular order along the narrow
paths. Low bridges, usually without railings,
cross the tiny pond, in which there are often
double-tailed goldfish and carp which rise to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[pg&nbsp;343]</span>
the surface when you clap your hands. Some
enclosures even contain gaily coloured pheasants,
ducks and storks.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center"><i>A Japanese Garden, Tokyo</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Curiously shaped stones are carefully selected
for the garden, each one having a name
and a meaning attached to it. Standing upright
in the centre should be the high &quot;guardian
stone.&quot; You may look for the &quot;worshipping
stone&quot; in the foreground or on an island; you
will find the &quot;perfect view&quot; on the hillside or
in some prominent place; you discover the
&quot;water-tray stone&quot; on the pond shore, and
the &quot;shadow stone&quot; in the valley between two
hills. Next to the &quot;worshipping stone&quot; is the
&quot;seat of honour,&quot; which is flat and horizontal.
The &quot;snail&quot; is the most important stepping-stone.</p>

<p class="indent">Trees as well as stones have rank in the miniature
landscape. The principal tree is the
largest, and is as a rule either a pine or an oak.
One in a secluded corner with thick foliage to
afford shade is called the &quot;tree of solitude.&quot;
The &quot;perfection tree&quot; should have fine
branches. Around the waterfall is planted the
&quot;cascade circuit,&quot; consisting of low bushes;
and in the background is the &quot;setting-sun
tree,&quot; which is turned westward in order to
screen the garden somewhat from the rays of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[pg&nbsp;344]</span>
the sun, and is often a maple that will light up
the place with its own glow in the autumn.</p>

<p class="indent">In the literature of gardens we read of male
and female cascades and rocks&mdash;just as of
male and female styles of flower arrangement&mdash;the
big one being the male, the smaller one
near-by the female. The flowering tree is also
considered a male, the plant in the same pot
a female.</p>

<p class="indent">The dwarf trees, that looked so strange when
we first saw them, soon became to us one of
the delightful features of gardening in Japan.
These, as well as the gardens themselves, originated
in the love of nature, the Japanese wishing
to have about them reduced copies of trees
which they admired. As the demand for these
pigmies has greatly increased in recent years
and the process of dwarfing is slow, Japanese
florists have discovered a way of making them
by a speedier method. When they find old,
stunted trees that have taken on unusual shapes&mdash;those
that have become gnarled and twisted
by growing among rocks are especially good for
this purpose&mdash;they cut them back very closely,
root and branch, then leave them to grow for
a time in the soil. After this they take up the
plants carefully without disturbing the earth
immediately about the roots, and place them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[pg&nbsp;345]</span>
pots. Trees even one hundred years old have
been successfully treated in this way.</p>

<p class="indent">But this is not &quot;real dwarfing,&quot; which was
described to me by my Japanese gardener.
For this process, if you wish to keep the tree
very small, it is raised from seed sown in a
pot. After the seedling has made the growth
of the first year, it is taken up, and the earth
is carefully shaken off the roots and replaced
with soil adapted to the special needs of the
tree, which is allowed to grow for two or three
years. Then it is time to begin trimming it
into shape, and here the same symbolic arrangement
is followed as in <i>Ike-bana</i>, based upon the
three main branches, Heaven, Man and Earth.
Root-pruning must also be started after the
growing season is over, and the larger roots
cut away, leaving only the finer ones. If the
branches run out too far in one direction, their
growth is stopped by cutting off the roots on
that side. A tree that is to be kept very small
is not repotted until the roots have filled the
pot; one that is to make a larger growth is
transferred at an earlier date. By scraping off
the top of the soil occasionally and putting on
fresh earth repotting may be postponed for
eight or ten years according to the kind of tree.</p>

<p class="indent">Dwarf maples from seed are ready for sale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[pg&nbsp;346]</span>
in two or three years; seedling pines require
from five to ten years to fit them for the market,
and plums four or five years. Lately, however,
it has become the custom to graft the plum,
cutting back the tree until only a contorted old
stump is left, and grafting upon this. We had
two such trees at the Embassy, which were
simply old stumps filled with plum blossoms,
one cluster pink and the other white, diffusing
their perfume all over the house. They were
very beautiful with a plain gold screen for a
background.</p>

<p class="indent">All kinds of evergreens, oaks and maples, the
plum and some other flowering trees, bamboos
and every sort of flowering shrub, and some
vines, such as the wisteria and the morning glory,
are all used for dwarfing. Plants having
thorns are never treated in this way, neither
are they used in the decoration of shrines nor
in real Japanese flower arrangement. For this
reason the large, fine roses in which we take
such delight, had never been cultivated in Japan
until perhaps forty years ago, when the first one
was brought from Holland, and the method of
cultivation was also borrowed from the Dutch.</p>

<p class="indent">In gardens, these diminutive trees are carefully
shaded from the rays of the afternoon
sun, and special pains are taken to keep them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>[pg&nbsp;347]</span>
well watered. When the temperature is above
ninety degrees, they are watered three times
a day&mdash;at eleven in the morning, and at two
and five in the afternoon. If they are used as
house plants, the care of them is a dignified
occupation, in which even nobles and princes
may engage in their own homes. As the use
of ordinary fertilizers might be disagreeable
to these exalted personages on account of their
bad odour, a pleasant and economical way has
been found of supplying the small quantity of
nourishment needed from eggs. After an egg
has been broken and the yolk and the white
removed, the shell, with the small amount of
albumen that adheres to it, is taken in the hand
and the broken edge touched here and there
to the soil of the pot, leaving on each spot a
tiny drop of white of egg. This process, repeated
from day to day, furnishes the little
tree with all the nutriment it requires. Milk
is also sometimes fed to these plants by the
Japanese, who have discovered that it gives
brighter colours to the flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">We visited a charming exposition of pigmy
trees in Shiba. Many gentlemen of Tokyo
had sent their tiny plants and miniature vases,
<i>hibachi</i>, lacquers, books and jades to decorate
the doll-house rooms. These playthings are in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>[pg&nbsp;348]</span>
many cases of great antiquity and value, and
lovely in quality and colour; as much pains
and taste are required to arrange these little
expositions as to decorate the large rooms of
a palace. On account of our visit the gardener
had taken particular trouble, and he showed
us all the fairy articles with loving hands and
words. There were microscopic trees an inch
high and landscapes two inches long, which
were a real delight, so exquisite were they.
Such trees are really works of art, and some
of them indeed as valuable as gems. About us,
in pots of beautiful form and colour, were the
dwarf trees of fantastic shape&mdash;stunted plum
in fragrant bloom, white and pink, and gnarled
trees hundreds of years old with blossoming
branches springing out of seemingly dead
trunks.</p>

<p class="indent">The Arsenal Gardens in Tokyo are said to
have been formerly the most wonderful in the
country. Koraku-en, their Japanese name&mdash;literally
translated, &quot;past pleasant recalling,&quot;&mdash;probably
means &quot;full of pleasant remembrances.&quot;
They were designed some three hundred
years ago with the object of reproducing
in miniature many of the most renowned scenes
in the Island Empire. In front of the pavilion,
however, is a lake which is copied from a noted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>[pg&nbsp;349]</span>
one in China called Soi-ko. Beyond the lake
rises a wooded hill, on which stands a small,
beautifully carved replica of the famous temple
Kiyomisu at Kyoto. Lower down the hill is a
little stream spanned by an accurate copy of
the well-known bridge at Nikko; further on
is the shrine of Haky-i and Shiky-sei, the loyal
brothers of Chinese legend. An arched stone
bridge leads to still another shrine, and from
this a path through a thicket of creepers conducts
to a lake covered with lotus and fed by
a stream which forms a lovely cascade. Another
path crosses little mountains through
thick foliage of bamboo and pine, passes the
artificial sea with its treasure island in the
centre, and leads over bridges, by waterfalls
and around temples.</p>

<p class="indent">In these gardens the Japanese most perfectly
realized their desire to transfer the features
of a natural landscape to their immediate surroundings;
here were magnificent trees of
great size, lakes and streams and mountains
in miniature, and a wide jungle of grass and
bamboo. Through the noise and dust and dilapidation
due to the encroachments of the Arsenal
workshops, one can still catch a glimpse of the
underlying plan and imagine the ancient beauties
of Koraku-en.</p>

<h2><a name="chXV" id="chXV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="h3">THE ARTIST&#39;S JAPAN</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;The great characteristic of Japanese art is its intense and
extraordinary vitality, in the sense that it is no mere exotic
cultivation of the skilful, no mere graceful luxury of the rich,
but a part of the daily lives of the people themselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="right">  <i>Mortimer Menpes.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/illo_329.jpg" width="100" height="117" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AT every turn of the head the artist in
Japan discerns a picture that delights
his eye&mdash;a quaint little figure
dressed in bright colours standing by
a twisted tree, a fantastic gateway through
which he sees a miniature garden, or the curving
roof of a temple, half hidden among the
trees.</p>

<p class="indent">As architecture is always more or less affected
by climate, the Japanese, in their land
of earthquakes and typhoons, have put up low
wooden structures, using cedar or fir principally,
because they are plentiful. The laws require
that houses shall not exceed six <i>kin</i>, or
fathoms, in height, but allow warehouses, or
<i>godowns</i>, which are more substantially built,
to be carried up much higher. If by any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>[pg&nbsp;351]</span>
chance a house has two stories, the second is
very low. When I asked the reason for such
a law in China, where they have a similar one,
I was told the wind gods did not like tall
buildings, but I was also assured that it was
partly to keep missionaries from building high
churches. In Japan, I think it is probably on
account of the danger of earthquakes.</p>

<p class="indent">Owing to the rainy seasons in spring and
autumn, the houses have no cellars and are set
on low piles. The summers are very warm and
the winters are fairly cold, so the <i>shoji</i>, or
sliding screen, without windows, was no doubt
developed for that reason. Every house can be
thrown open in summer and closed tightly in
winter. As fires are frequent, no house is expected
to last many years, and therefore the
Japanese store their valuables in fire-proof
<i>godowns</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The &quot;Flower of Yedo&quot; blossomed gloriously
the other night, for hundreds of the tiny
fragile houses went up in smoke, and thousands
of people were made homeless. These
Flowers of Yedo are the conflagrations that
time after time spread through wide districts
of the Capital with startling rapidity and leave
nothing behind. Two days after the fire, little
houses and fences of fresh new wood were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[pg&nbsp;352]</span>
springing up, for the people have been accustomed
from time immemorial to these &quot;Blossoms
of the Flower.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In olden times the roofs were covered with
thatch, but the danger from fires is so great
that this has been replaced on many houses by
tiles. In China it is said that the fashion of
curving the roofs of buildings originated in
order that the devil, when sliding down over
them, might be tossed up again; in Japan,
there are also curving roofs and&mdash;in the interior
of the country&mdash;upon the outer walls
there are drawings of the god Jizo, who carries
a large sword in both hands to ward off
misfortune.</p>

<p class="indent">In Japanese dwellings the kitchen is at one
side of the front door. The rooms seldom have
more than one solid wall, the others consisting
of paper screens. In this solid wall there is
always a <i>toko-noma</i>, or alcove, raised about a
foot above the floor of the room and perhaps
two feet deep. It should stand opposite the
entrance, and is the most honourable place in
the house. Here, where the <i>kakemono</i>&mdash;a perpendicular,
panel-shaped picture&mdash;is hung,
and a rare porcelain vase of flowers may stand,
is the seat of honour. At one side of the <i>toko-noma</i>
is a cupboard&mdash;the place for the &quot;honourable&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>[pg&nbsp;353]</span>
book&mdash;and above this is a drawer
where the writing-box is kept, also the wooden
pillow. In some houses a square hole is found
under the mat, in which a fire is built for
warmth or for cooking purposes. Where there
are none of these &quot;fire holes,&quot; prettily decorated
jars of charcoal, called <i>hibachi</i>, are used.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>shoji</i> is often adorned with paintings or
made of beautiful carved wood. The hammered
brass, the lacquered and polished wood,
and the superb ceilings add much to the beauty
of the homes of the rich.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 550px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">A CARVED PANEL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Wood carving, both inside and out, is such
a feature of the houses as well as the temples
that it deserves mention here. At the entrances
to fine places and also on the slanting
roof over the doorway of the house itself superb
carvings are often seen. So many designs
and colours are introduced, especially on temple
gates, that full scope is given to the imagination
and taste of the artist. The famous cat,
for instance, on one of the gates at Nikko, is
so wonderfully carved and so life-like that it
is said to frighten the rats away. Bahu, the
Eater of Dreams, and the ph&oelig;nix and other
imaginary animals also appear in Japanese
wood carving.</p>

<p class="indent">Temples are built on rising ground because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>[pg&nbsp;354]</span>
the people believe that the gods are pleased
with high places. The old castles and temples
are finer architecturally than other buildings,
the former, which were built upon hills or beside
great rivers, being extremely picturesque.
They are many-storied, pyramidal structures,
with curving roofs and gables projecting over
each story. The buildings generally stand in
three enclosures, each surrounded by a wall or
moat, and cover a large extent of ground. The
innermost, chief castle, is a large, square tower,
three or four stories high, in which lived the
lord in feudal times. The gentlemen of the
household dwelt within the second enclosure,
and in the outer one the soldiers and servants
had their quarters.</p>

<p class="indent">In the erection of castles and pagodas which
have stood for many centuries, the Japanese
have shown not only their skill as architects
but also their knowledge of the principles of
construction. Castles and the sides of moats
are built of huge blocks of stone, some of those
at Osaka being over thirty feet long and fifteen
feet high, but the walls, slanting from base to
apex, are really pyramids, which are supported
within and bound together by enormous timbers.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the most interesting of these old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[pg&nbsp;355]</span>
structures are the castle at Nagoya and that at
Kumamoto, in Kyushu; the castle of Himeji is
the most perfectly preserved. Kumamoto was
built in its present fashion in 1607, and in the
Saigo rebellion of 1877 it held out successfully
against a large force of rebels, showing no lack
of strength in its construction. The castle at
Osaka, one hundred and twenty feet high and
commanding an extensive view over the River
Temma and the surrounding country, was once
the finest fortress in the East, but has since
been partially destroyed in various sieges.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 700px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">THE CASTLE OF HIMEJI.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Pagodas&mdash;which are really towers with a
series of curving roofs&mdash;are very striking in
appearance and most artistic. Some of them
have stood for seven hundred years or more,
and many of them are kept upright by an exceedingly
ingenious device. In the centre, suspended
from the top by one end, hangs an immense
log, the lower part of which is surrounded
by four other logs of the same size,
firmly bolted to it. The base of this enormous
structure is about an inch from the earth at the
bottom of the pagoda, so that it forms a mighty
pendulum, which in case of earthquake sways
sufficiently to keep the building stable.</p>

<p class="indent">When we discover that in Japan every person
is an artist, we wonder at the universal deftness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[pg&nbsp;356]</span>
and skill in handiwork, until we learn that
Japanese calligraphy is itself a fine art. Every
character is an exercise in freehand drawing,
each stroke of the brush, which is filled with
India ink, being made by a quick movement of
the forearm without support for the wrist.</p>

<p class="indent">The methods of Japanese painters are very
different from those of Western artists. They
begin work with a burnt twig, often on a piece
of prepared silk, afterward using the brush
with India ink and water colours. Each one
values his own special cake of India ink very
highly. They do not draw directly from the
object, but study it for hours in every detail,
and then draw from memory. After a picture
is well thought out, its execution may require
only five or ten minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">Japanese artists have conventional types of
beauty, as the Greeks had. A woman must
have a forehead narrow at the top, eyebrows
far above the eyes, eyelids scarcely visible, and
a small mouth. A man should have greatly exaggerated
muscles, and arms and legs placed
in almost impossible attitudes. Their pictures
abound in bold, sweeping lines&mdash;the touch of
power&mdash;and perhaps for that reason, they
have great admiration for Michel Angelo&#39;s
work.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>[pg&nbsp;357]</span>
Although we may know the colour prints of
the Japanese better than their paintings, it is
nevertheless true that their leading painters
rank among the great artists of the world. Pictures
were painted for the aristocracy; the
colour prints, which cost but a trifle, were made
for the common people. Painting was introduced
into Japan by Buddhist priests, and
some of the finest masterpieces are shut up
from the world in the temples of Buddha.
Many of them, however, have been reproduced
in the beautiful series of wood cuts published
by the Japanese Government. America has
two collections of the original paintings which
are finer than any in Europe&mdash;that in the
Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and the Freer
collection in Detroit.</p>

<p class="indent">Painting, as a fine art, has existed in Japan
for twelve centuries. The oldest picture recorded
is said to have been done on the wall of
a temple at Nara in the early part of the seventh
century. The ninth century was the first
great literary and artistic era of Japan, when
Kanaoka lived, who is called the greatest master
in the whole history of Japanese painting.
His works included not only Buddhistic figures
but also animals, landscapes and portraits.</p>

<p class="indent">Tradition has it that the peasants in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[pg&nbsp;358]</span>
neighbourhood of a certain Buddhist temple
were greatly troubled on account of the havoc
wrought in their gardens by the nightly visits
of some large animal. Setting a watch, they
discovered the intruder to be a magnificent
black horse, which took refuge from his pursuers
in the temple. They entered, but no horse
was there, except one superbly painted by
Kanaoka. As they stood beneath the picture,
drops of sweat fell upon them&mdash;the horse was
hot and steaming! Then one of the peasants
caught up a brush, and painted into the picture
a halter which fastened the horse to a post.
This was effective; he never again foraged in
the peasants&#39; gardens.</p>

<p class="indent">The earliest purely Japanese school was the
Tosa, which originated in the tenth century. A
glorious artistic period covered the three centuries
from the eleventh to the fourteenth. It
was in 1351 that the great Cho Densu was born,
who has been styled &quot;the Fra Angelico of
Japan.&quot; By some critics he is ranked with
Kanaoka himself. Although he was a Buddhist
priest he did not confine himself to religious
subjects, but was equally great in other
lines.</p>

<p class="indent">The Kano School was founded in the fifteenth
century. This was the period of the masters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>[pg&nbsp;359]</span>
of landscape painting, among whom Sesshiu is
the most famous. His landscapes are full of
grandeur and dignity, but it is said his figure
paintings must be seen before his power can be
appreciated. He went to China for study, but
to his disappointment could find no artist who
could teach him anything he did not already
know. Then he said, &quot;Nature shall be my
teacher; I will go to the woods, the mountains
and the streams, and learn of them.&quot; As he
travelled through the country in carrying out
his purpose, he found Chinese artists came to
study with him. The Emperor of China engaged
him to paint a series of panels on the
walls of the palace in Peking, and on one of
them, as testimony that the work was done by
a Japanese painter, he depicted the peerless
Fuji.</p>

<p class="indent">In the seventeenth century arose the Ukioye,
or Popular School, of which Moronobu and
Hokusai were the great artists. They are perhaps
even better known for their prints. The
Naturalistic School, more like European work
than that of the earlier artists, was founded by
Okio in the eighteenth century. To this group
belonged Ippo, a fine landscapist, and Sosen,
one of the famous animal painters of the world,
particularly known for his pictures of monkeys.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>[pg&nbsp;360]</span>
Yosai, who died in 1878, was the last great
Japanese painter. He studied in all the
schools, and combined some of the best characteristics
of each. Since his death there have
been clever painters but no great artists.</p>

<p class="indent">Like many other things in Japan to-day, her
art of painting is in the transition stage. There
are two schools, the conservatives, who cling
to the art of ancient days, and the progressives,
who believe that they must borrow fresh
conceptions from the Western masters, and
feel that want of reality has been a defect in
the old Japanese work. However, in copying
Western methods, they are introducing vulgar
subjects, from which Japanese painting has
generally been free. At the art exhibitions of
1913 there were ninety-three who entered oil
paintings; this alone shows the great change
in their work. While the Japanese painters of
to-day cannot escape the influence of European
art, it is to be hoped that they will not lose
the delicacy of treatment, the subtle suggestiveness,
and the grace and sweep of line that
belonged to the old masters.</p>

<p class="indent">To my mind the most interesting things for
Europeans to collect in Japan are the prints,
which first came in vogue about 1690. The
Japanese have, in these, added a charm quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>[pg&nbsp;361]</span>
their own to every thought which they have
received from other nations. The conditions
under which the artists worked in olden times
were most favourable, for they lived under the
protection of the great <i>daimyos</i>, were supplied
with the necessities of life, and were free from
care.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Keane, of Yokohama, is an authority on
old prints, of which he has made several collections.
&quot;We lunched one day with him at his
home in the upper part of his office building
on the Bund, in Yokohama. (When foreign
merchants first went to Japan they always lived
over their places of business.) The view over
the sparkling harbour and away off to the horizon,
where little fleets of slanting-sailed sampans
were working their way up the Bay of
Yedo with the sunlight striking their sails, was
really superb. Mr. Keane stores his prints in
a safe, but for the enjoyment of his guests he
took them out on the day of the luncheon. They
were so much finer and more interesting than
the common, every-day prints of the dealers
that they quite took our breath away.</p>

<p class="indent">Of American collections, that of Mr. William
Spalding, in Boston, is particularly good, including,
as it does, some beautiful rare figures
in black and white by Matabei, the father of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>[pg&nbsp;362]</span>
Ukioye school of painting, from which the art of
colour printing is derived. Mr. Spalding has
hand-coloured prints by Moronobu, some of
which are in orange-red and old rose. In some
cases the paper of the old prints takes on a
beautiful yellow autumn glow with age, which
adds to their beauty. The colours yellow, black,
orange and green were introduced about 1765.
For the orange-red and old rose red-lead (<i>tan</i>)
was used, hence the prints of this kind were
called <i>tan-ye</i>, and are of great value to-day.
Moronobu was a wonderful draughtsman, and
his figures in black and white are greatly prized.</p>

<p class="indent">Masanobu and Kiyonobu were prominent
among the early artists, but the perfection of
technique in prints was reached under Kiyonaga.</p>

<p class="indent">Utamaro, who became the leading print designer
of his day, lived in the latter part of
the eighteenth century, when the art of making
these wood cuts was at its best. Unfortunately
his whole life was a career of dissipation; his
father disowned him, and he was finally put in
prison for libelling the Shogun. Soon after
that, his health gave way, and he died at the
age of fifty-three. Toward the end of his life,
however, he was so popular and so overwhelmed
with commissions that in his endeavour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>[pg&nbsp;363]</span>
to fulfill orders his later work degenerated.
Utamaro&#39;s style was copied by his pupils, and
his signature was so often forged that it is
difficult to pick out his prints. His chief works
were pictures of <i>geishas</i>, in which the long lines
of the kimonos are much admired. His were
the first colour prints to reach Europe through
the Dutch.</p>

<p class="indent">Toyokuni was another master of the same
period, whose favourite subjects were actors in
character. In this sort of print and in his technique
he was unsurpassed.</p>

<p class="indent">Hiroshige&mdash;two of whose pupils took his
name&mdash;lived at the beginning of the downfall
of Japanese colour printing. He was a prolific
worker, and his wood cuts are delicate and seldom
show strong contrasts. He is especially
noted for landscapes, and did views of the Inland
Sea, of snow scenes, and of mists and
rains, in very delicate pastel colours. Eight
famous views of Lake Biwa, as well as several
sets of the Tokaido, were done by this artist.
Heads by Sharaku with a silver background
are very striking, and have lately become the
rage in Paris. They certainly have strength
and individuality, but they are hideous beyond
words. He was especially fond of doing actors,
and the faces are full of expression.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>[pg&nbsp;364]</span>
Hokusai, whom Whistler called &quot;the greatest
pictorial artist since Vandyke,&quot; is placed
by European critics at the head of all colour-print
designers, but in Japan is considered
second-rate. For one reason, the Japanese
cannot forgive the vulgarity of some of his
subjects. We might well apply to him the name
given to the school of art of which he is the
best example&mdash;Ukioye, &quot;Mirror of the Passing
World.&quot; He was born in 1760, and started
as an engraver, but became a book-illustrator
at an early age. At eighteen he went into the
studio of Shunsho as a pupil, but his work was
so original and so unlike his master&#39;s that he
was soon expelled. After that, he was so poor
that he peddled in the streets of Tokyo.</p>

<p class="indent">Later, Hokusai collaborated with the successful
novelist Bakin for many years. The famous
set of prints of a hundred views of Fuji,
the series of the waterfalls of Japan, the noted
bridges, the scenes in the Loochoo Islands, as
well as the views of the Tokaido, were all done
in the latter part of his life. Hokusai used
strong colours, and produced fine work. He
was most unfortunate in having all his original
studies destroyed by fire, and as he was careless
about money matters he died in poverty.
Just before his death&mdash;in 1849&mdash;he said, &quot;If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>[pg&nbsp;365]</span>
fate had given me but five years more, I should
have been able to become a true painter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Entirely green and entirely red prints, I was
told, were rare. I never saw but one wholly
green print in Japan, but that sold for a small
sum, so perhaps I was misinformed as to its
value. I was also told that the prints entirely
in red were made to amuse the lepers in olden
days, so were destroyed afterward, hence few
exist, but as I find some collectors never heard
of this story, again I am in doubt. The triptychs
are particularly valuable to-day. The
long strips&mdash;the pillar prints&mdash;were made for
the poorer classes, the <i>kakemono</i> for the nobles.
Both paintings and prints are usually in one
of two shapes, either the <i>kakemono</i>, or long
scroll, or the <i>makemono</i>, the horizontal picture.
The former are not framed, so they can easily
be rolled and stowed away when not wanted
for decoration.</p>

<p class="indent">The blocks on which the prints were engraved
were made of cherry wood, both sides of which
were used for economy&#39;s sake. The design on
thin Japanese paper was pasted on the block,
face downward, then the wood was cut by the
engraver. Black ink was used in the first stages
of the reproduction. Proofs were then taken
by hand-pressure and pasted on other blocks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>[pg&nbsp;366]</span>
one for each colour. &quot;&#39;Each of these colour-blocks
was then cut in a manner to leave a flat
surface of the correct form to receive the pigment
proper to it; and the finished print was
the result of a careful and extraordinarily skilful
rubbing on all the blocks in succession, beginning
with the key block.&#39;&quot;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>

A B C of Japanese Art.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Some of the great Japanese painters designed
prints, others did not. Often it is difficult
to distinguish by whom a print was designed,
notwithstanding the signature, because
artists sometimes gave their own name to their
favourite pupil. For this reason and many
others, beware of the print-dealer.</p>

<p class="indent">The highly developed artistic sense of the
Japanese has found expression in various ways,
but their deftness and delicacy of touch has led
them especially to the production of small objects
that delight the collector of curios. There
is the <i>netsuke</i> in endless variety; the <i>inro</i>, or
small medicine chest; the ornamental sword-hilt;
minute wood carvings; besides bronzes
and porcelain in shapes innumerable.</p>

<p class="indent">Collectors will show you with great pride
their <i>netsuke</i>. These were worn as ornaments
attached to the cord of the tobacco pouch to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>[pg&nbsp;367]</span>
prevent it from slipping through the sash. The
<i>inro</i> and the pocketbook were also worn in the
same way. The oldest and most valuable <i>netsuke</i>
were made of the heart-wood of the
cherry, which becomes a rich brown colour with
age, and some were beautifully carved.</p>

<p class="indent">A very old wooden <i>netsuke</i>, which was presented
to us, represents the goddess Uzume-no-Mikoto,
popularly known as Okame. She
was so beautiful that she could not be pictured.
As it was impossible to reproduce her charms,
a face was chosen to represent her that in no
way was a likeness, but was sufficiently individual
never to be mistaken. She is made very
fat in the cheeks, and sits in the shade of a
mushroom.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Netsuke</i> are also found in ivory, bone and
jade. Many are images of gods and goddesses,
and some are humourous figures. A beautiful
ivory one that was given us is in the form of
a turtle, which signifies long life, but on the
under side is one of the seven gods of luck with
his shiny bald head.</p>

<p class="indent">During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
the <i>inro</i> was worn as an ornament, and
no man of taste would consider himself well
dressed without it. This led many of the great
artists to design them. Among the well-known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[pg&nbsp;368]</span>
<i>inro</i> artists were Jokasai, Iizuka and Saiihara-Ichidayu,
but there are so many others who are
noted in Japan that it is impossible to give
them all here. Some of the finest specimens of
their work are found to-day in the Imperial
Museum in Tokyo. Many of these are of lacquer,
minutely and exquisitely carved, those in
gold lacquer and dark red being the most valuable.</p>

<p class="indent">There are lacquer vases and boxes, too, but
the fine old lacquers are not easy to get nowadays.
Writing-boxes, some of which are in
charming designs, are also much in demand for
collectors. Some of our writing-boxes are of
deeply carved old red lacquer, depicting houses
and landscapes. One is of gold and black with
tinted maple leaves, exquisite in design. Another
has a background of speckled gold, on
which are dwarf cherry trees with blossoms of
enamel, and still another of gold lacquer is
inlaid with mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p class="indent">Sculpture, like painting, was brought to
Japan by Buddhist priests, and many of the
earliest statues were figures of gods and goddesses.
These were usually of bronze or wood,
not so often of stone. As early as the seventh
century fine bronzes were cast at Nara, and
over a hundred altar-pieces of that period are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>[pg&nbsp;369]</span>
still in existence in Japan. To a somewhat
later age belongs the colossal Buddha of Nara,
the largest statue ever cast in bronze. The
Great Buddha of Kamakura, rather smaller but
of finer workmanship than that at Nara, is
believed to date from the thirteenth century.</p>

<p class="indent">Old bronzes are much sought after by collectors,
the best dating from the seventeenth
century. Vast numbers of gods and goddesses
and mythical animals were made of small size
to be set up in houses as well as temples.
Among these some of the Buddhas and Kwannons
are fine. Buddha has many attitudes&mdash;sleeping,
exhorting or meditating&mdash;and all are
interesting.</p>

<p class="indent">Temple-lanterns, candlesticks, bells and incense-burners
were also made of bronze in
forms showing great wealth of imagination.
The beautiful old bronzes are of several kinds&mdash;gold
and silver, and many shades of green
and brown. The gold bronze takes on a wonderful
polish, and can be made in different
colours according to the proportions of the
metals used in the alloys, varying from a
deep-blue violet to a red-yellow or a golden
green. The silver bronze has a fine silver-grey
tint. These metals are also used in combination
with gold lacquers and with mother-of-pearl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>[pg&nbsp;370]</span>
and silver, or are encrusted with charming
relief designs in enamels.</p>

<p class="indent">In the entrance hall of our Washington house
is a huge green bronze Buddha, at least ten
feet high, with tight curls upon his head, half-shut
eyes, and the big ear-lobes, which signify
longevity. In the bronze halo about his head
are small figures of Kwannon, and Chinese
characters decorate his garment. With one
hand uplifted, he sits serene and imperturbable,
cross-legged on his lotus flower.</p>

<p class="indent">Not far from the Buddha is a bronze Kwannon
about five feet high, a gracefully draped
figure, standing on a large petal of the lotus.
About her neck are jewels, and behind her
crown is a small image of Buddha, typifying
her ever-present thought of him.</p>

<p class="indent">We also have a shrine that we prize greatly&mdash;a
modern shrine, perhaps five feet in height,
such as is found in a Japanese gentleman&#39;s
house. The exterior is of black lacquer, but
when the folding doors are open, the interior
is seen to be golden. In the centre stands a
small Buddha; the wise men&mdash;his advisers&mdash;sit
cross-legged on either side. The carving in
this shrine is slightly tinted in colours, mixed
with gold, and is indescribably fine and beautiful.
A <i>No</i> dance is depicted for the entertainment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>[pg&nbsp;371]</span>
of the Buddha, above which are palaces,
people and animals, supposed to represent
scenes in heaven. On either side hang two
bronze lanterns. On the table before the shrine
are the ceremonial utensils, consisting of an
incense-burner, two flower vases, and two candelabra.
Below is a gong for the devotee to
strike, in order to call the Buddha&#39;s attention,
and near-by is the box containing the holy
books.</p>

<p class="indent">In feudal days the <i>samurai</i> went into battle
clad in breast-plate and helmet, gauntlets and
coat-of-mail, all of which were adorned by the
armourer&#39;s skill, but the most beautiful decorations
were lavished upon the sword&mdash;&quot;the
soul of the <i>samurai</i>.&quot; The <i>shakudo</i>&mdash;sword-hilt&mdash;is
a curio that people collect. The inlaying
and overlaying and blending of metals
that was done on arms and armour in olden
times was marvellous, and even the metal-work
of to-day is remarkably clever. Besides the
sword-hilt, there was the sword-guard, a flat
piece of metal, often in exquisite designs.</p>

<p class="indent">Pottery from Korea and porcelain from
China, of course, had some influence in Japan.
The Japanese are considered very fine potters,
perhaps the best in the world, and their old
ware is highly prized. The handsome old pottery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>[pg&nbsp;372]</span>
made in Kyoto and also that of Bizen are
much valued by Japanese collectors, and the
work of such famous men as Nomura, Ninsei,
and others is highly esteemed. Old Imari and
Arita wares are considered choice, as well as
Satsuma, but all of them, especially Satsuma,
are much imitated to-day.</p>

<p class="indent">The Arita, a blue ware, is thought very
pretty, but not until after German methods
were introduced did it attain perfection. The
Seto porcelain, made in the Tokugawa Period,
is very well known. Kutani is especially popular
in America, and Awada ware is also in
demand in the foreign market. The cream-white
made to-day in Kyoto is particularly attractive.
Neither the ancient nor the modern
Japanese porcelains, however, compare with
the old Chinese, some people even going so
far as to say that the only things in the Far
East worth collecting are old Chinese porcelains.</p>

<p class="indent">Incense-burners are made in porcelain and
bronze, and are beautifully modelled in the
form of gods and goddesses, and of birds and
other animals. Curiously enough, besides their
office in worship, they were used in playing a
game, which consisted in guessing the name of
the perfume that was burning.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>[pg&nbsp;373]</span>
There are attractive lacquer and porcelain
<i>saké</i> cups to collect, and so many charming
modern things that I will not mention any more,
except the wonderful crystal balls, so clear and
mysterious that they quite hypnotize you if you
look into their depths. The legend called &quot;The
Crystal of Buddha&quot; seems to show that these
balls were originally introduced from China.
I insert the story here in order that we may
always be reminded of the delightful mythology
of Japan as well as of the treasures of the land.
In a few words it is this:</p>

<p class="indent">A beautiful Japanese girl became the wife
of the Emperor of China. Before she left
Japan, she promised to send back three treasures
to the Temple of Kofukuji. The Chinese
Emperor found her very charming and loved
her very much, and when she told him of her
promise, he put before her many curios to
choose from. She finally decided upon three
fairy treasures&mdash;a musical instrument which
would continue to play for ever, an ink-stone
box which was inexhaustible, and the last, in
Madame Ozaki&#39;s words, &quot;A beautiful crystal
in whose clear depths was to be seen from
whichever side you looked, an image of Buddha
riding on a white elephant. The jewel was of
transcendent glory, and shone like a star, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>[pg&nbsp;374]</span>
whoever gazed into its liquid depths and saw
the blessed vision of Buddha had peace of heart
for evermore.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But alas! while the treasures were on their
way to Japan, there arose a terrible storm,
during which the crystal ball was stolen by the
Dragon King of the Sea. A poor fisherwoman
at last found it shining in the depths of the
ocean. While in bathing, &quot;she suddenly became
aware of the roofs of the palace of the
Sea King, a great and gorgeous building of
coral, relieved here and there with clusters of
many-coloured seaweeds. The palace was like
a huge pagoda rising tier upon tier. She perceived
a bright light, more brilliant than the
light of many moons. It was the light of Buddha&#39;s
crystal placed on the pinnacle of this vast
abode, and on every side of the shining jewel
were guardian dragons fast asleep, appearing
to watch even in their slumber.&quot; The fisherwoman
stole the jewel, but it cost her her life.
In reward for her bravery her son was brought
up as a <i>samurai</i>, so the wish she had most at
heart was gratified.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AT the close of the last administration,
L. resigned his post, and with real
regret we prepared to leave the Land
of a Million Swords. We had experienced
nothing but the pleasantest relations with
the Japanese, nor had we at any time heard of
rudeness to Americans.</p>

<p class="indent">The day we sailed L. was besieged with people
who came to say good-bye. Among those
who called were Mr. Sakai and Mr. Yoshida,
for the Foreign Office. Mr. Matsui, the Vice-Minister
of Foreign Affairs, brought us a superb
basket of flowers, while Mr. Nagasaki,
Master of Ceremonies at Court, presented us
with some orchids from the Imperial greenhouse.</p>

<p class="indent">Best of all, as we thought at the time, Mr.
Baba, Master of Ceremonies to the Empress,
came with a magnificent gold lacquer box from
Her Majesty. We received him in state in
the parlour, and with much ceremony and repeated
bows he presented the gift, accompanying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>[pg&nbsp;376]</span>
it with many pleasant messages from the
Empress. In return we bowed and expressed
our gratitude for the great honour, speaking
of our love for the country and our deep regret
at leaving, and adding that we should
always have the happiest memories of our
stay in beautiful Japan. The most gratifying
token of appreciation, however, has come
to my husband since his withdrawal from the
diplomatic service. This is the grand cordon
of the Order of the Rising Sun, First Class,
conferred in recognition of his efforts to promote
friendly relations between this country
and Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">Many people telephoned to know by what
train we were leaving, but we decided to slip
away to Yokohama in the motor. We looked
for the last time at the Embassy, with its pretty
garden, where we had been so happy, and getting
into the car were shot out of the porte-cochère
and around the circle, waving good-bye
to some of the Staff and the servants who stood
bowing at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">At the Consulate in Yokohama L. joined Mr.
Sammons, the Consul-General, and went to a
luncheon at the Grand Hotel given in his honour
by the Asiatic and Columbia Societies, which
are composed of the American colony. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>[pg&nbsp;377]</span>
joined in drinking his health and in wishing
him a pleasant voyage and a speedy return.
In answer L. said that during his all too brief
stay in Japan he had come to realize the great
cordiality and hospitality of the American community
in Yokohama and other cities, and this
realization made it all the harder for him to
say farewell. After adding that each visit to
Japan only made him like the country better,
he closed by saying that while he was about
to cease to be officially the Ambassador from
one country to the other, he yet looked forward
to being in the future, unofficially, an ambassador
between the two, and hoped that he would
soon see many of those present at his home,
where they would always be welcome.</p>

<p class="indent">I went to Mrs. Sammons&#39; luncheon, where
she had several ladies as guests. The table
decorations were exquisite, in Japanese style.
After luncheon Mrs. Sammons took me in her
motor to the wharf, where we found L. waiting
for us with a number of people who had come
to see us off. Everybody cheered as we boarded
the launch, which took us to the steamer; there
we found baskets of flowers, candies, books,
and other gifts awaiting us.</p>

<p class="indent">In a few minutes the big ship began to shake
and the water to rush by, and we knew that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>[pg&nbsp;378]</span>
were off. Soon the sun, a great red disk&mdash;fitting
national emblem of Japan!&mdash;went down
in the glow of the dying day. Above the darkness,
which settled on earth and sea, rose the
mysterious cone of &quot;O Fuji-San,&quot; seeming detached
from all that was earthly below, a divine
spirit of a mountain-top, which slowly disappeared
as the night filled the heavens with stars.</p>

<p class="indent">As I sat in my steamer chair I had time to
think again and again of the land and the people
we had left behind. I remembered with
pleasure the pretty, gentle women with their
laughing, almond-eyed babies riding happily on
their mothers&#39; backs, and recalled with admiration
the Spartan men, so loyal to their country.
Closing my eyes I seemed to see the quaint
little streets, lined on either side with paper
houses, in front of which gay toys were displayed
for sale. Industrious workmen, making
curious objects with their deft fingers, sat in
their doorways, and painters also, designing
fantastic animals of the imagination. Once I
seemed to catch the perfume of the plum blossoms,
and with it I dreamed of golden temples
on the hillside and thought I heard a Buddhist
priest muttering to himself, &quot;All beings are
only dreaming in this fleeting world of unhappiness.&quot;</p>

Mixed in the fantastic medley of this dream
passed the animals of the years&mdash;the strutting
cock of 1912, the stolid bullock of 1913, and in
the distance the crouching tiger of the year to
come. Then I saw the little apes of Nikko,
sitting motionless before me&mdash;Mizaru, who
sees no evil, Kikazaru, who hears no evil, and
Mazaru, who speaks no evil. Above them all
flew the H-oo, the guiding bird of good omen,
which only appears to herald the coming of
peace and prosperity. May he bring them both
to Japan!</p>

<p class="indent">Many times since, on looking back, it has
seemed as if Dai Nippon must be all a dream&mdash;a
fairy island, perhaps, conjured out of the
sea by some mighty giant. I often wonder if
it did not truly sink into the sea beneath the
red eye of the setting sun.</p>

<p class="indent">When I am troubled about this, I get out
Osame&#39;s letter and read it again. It came to
us soon after we reached home, and is very
reassuring. In order that you, too, may know
that Japan is real, I will let you read it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Excellency</span>,&quot; he wrote L.,
&quot;when the first news of your coming
to Japan announced I could not feel
but the happiest news like from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>[pg&nbsp;380]</span>
Heaven, and only waited the day
might flew to your arriving date. The
joy and happiness reached its maximum
height when I had the pleasure
and delight of meeting you and Madam
once more at Kharbin. Three years
passed since your last visit and you
and Madam had not least changed, like
the peerless Fuji towering high above
the clouds I wished I had power to
show you the appreciation and gratitude
I always indebted to you, but it
was vain effort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;However Heaven blessed me that
you had an interview three years ago
with late Emperor and now again with
His Majesty his son, we look up to
them like a living God enthroned since
666 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> I was so pleased. Now alas
you passed away again from Japan at
four o&#39;clock on the fifteenth instant.
As I left the ship I could not utter a
word with the heart-rending unhappiness
of parting from you. The launch
blew the whistle thrice, and puffing out
a great column of smoke she slowly
moved away. I saw you fading sight
and thanked you for your kindness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>[pg&nbsp;381]</span>
watching me until we could not discern
each other. And the joy and happiness
rolled with the waves following
your course. With no sign of encouragement
I reached shore and out the
dream. I ran to the Post Office to
send a cable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope you are enjoying the best
health and the best time. Do not forget
this humble Osame, always with
you no matter what part of the planet
you may travel, and always glad and
feel happy to hear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please recommend me to one who
come to Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope I may be a little service to
you for the rare opportunity and honour
in my life. With the best wishes
for you and Okusuma, anxiously
awaiting to hear I remain</p>
